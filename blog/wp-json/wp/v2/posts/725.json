The 2015 Major League Baseball season is\u00a0in\u00a0full swing. In\u00a0celebratration of\u00a0America\u2019s pastime, we&#8217;ve come up\u00a0with a\u00a0list of\u00a0ten cool apps you\u2019ll need to\u00a0get you through the season (and hopefully into the playoffs). And speaking of\u00a0cool apps, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/mobile-development\">we\u00a0actually develop them<\/a>. That\u2019s one of\u00a0the many things we\u00a0do. So\u00a0if\u00a0you\u2019re looking to\u00a0have an\u00a0app created to\u00a0help grow your business, we\u00a0can help. Because remember, if\u00a0you build it, they will come.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here are the ten apps every baseball fan should have to\u00a0enhance their 2015 season:<\/p>\n<p><strong>#1. Track every pitch and every swing with MLB.com At\u00a0Bat.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is\u00a0the official app of\u00a0Major League Baseball. The free basic version gives you all the scores, breaking news, and player stats, as\u00a0well as\u00a0access to\u00a0watch a\u00a0free \u201cgame of\u00a0the day. If\u00a0you upgrade to\u00a0premium ($2.99\/mo.), you\u2019ll get real-time box scores, pitch by\u00a0pitch tracking and the ability to\u00a0listen to\u00a0live local radio broadcasts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2. Be\u00a0a\u00a0player with ESPN Fantasy Baseball.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If\u00a0you have an\u00a0ESPN Fantasy Baseball Team, then you need this free app. Add players, drop players, trade players. Keep up\u00a0to\u00a0date with real-time scoring and fantasy news. Hear from the experts with videos and Tweets from ESPN\u2019s fantasy analysts. Most importantly, you\u2019ll be\u00a0able to\u00a0talk trash as\u00a0you post messages to\u00a0your league\u2019s message board.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. Score great seats with StubHub.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>StubHub is\u00a0the go-to app for scoring tickets to\u00a0any game \u2013 especially those that are sold out. Here\u2019s a\u00a0hint: if\u00a0you want to\u00a0get a\u00a0really great seat at\u00a0a\u00a0decent price, consider buying a\u00a0single ticket. You may not be\u00a0sitting with your best bud, but you\u2019ll probably have a\u00a0better view of\u00a0the game. Besides, you can always meet up\u00a0with your bud for beer runs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4. Be\u00a0prepared for rain delays with The Weather Channel.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your game day outfit planning should start with a\u00a0quick check of\u00a0The Weather Channel\u2019s app. Find out if\u00a0you\u2019ll need to\u00a0take a\u00a0sweater for those early spring and late fall night games, or\u00a0if\u00a0you need to\u00a0pack an\u00a0umbrella (and a\u00a0bit of\u00a0patience) for any potential rain delays.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#5. Find an\u00a0affordable parking spot near the stadium with ParkWhiz.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u00a0all know what a\u00a0hassle parking can be\u00a0at\u00a0any major sporting event. The ParkWhiz app allows you to\u00a0reserve a\u00a0park ahead of\u00a0time and guarantee a\u00a0great rate. You can compare parking options and pay directly from the app. So\u00a0you can save your cash for tipping the beer guy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#6. For those afternoon games, avoid sunburn (and skin cancer!) with Ultraviolet UV\u00a0Index.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s nice to\u00a0enjoy a\u00a0sunny day at\u00a0the ballpark, it\u2019s the opposite of\u00a0nice to\u00a0go\u00a0home with a\u00a0painful and potentially dangerous sunburn. Use the Ultraviolet UV\u00a0Index app to\u00a0determine what level of\u00a0sunscreen you\u2019ll need for the day. Here\u2019s a\u00a0tip: keep an\u00a0extra bottle of\u00a0sunscreen in\u00a0your car or\u00a0bag just in\u00a0case you forget to\u00a0apply it\u00a0before you leave your house. Never let yourself go\u00a0unprotected.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#7. Plan your concessions attack with Hungry Fan.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the bottom of\u00a0the 4th, your team is\u00a0losing, and you\u2019re looking for a\u00a0frozen concoction to\u00a0help you hang\u00a0on. The Hungry Fan app can direct you to\u00a0your destination in\u00a0no\u00a0time. View menus and pricing for a\u00a0variety of\u00a0concessions in\u00a0your favorite stadium and find out exactly where you need to\u00a0go\u00a0to get your food &amp; drink fix. Now you can spend less time walking around trying to\u00a0find something to\u00a0eat and more time cheering your team to\u00a0victory.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#8. Crowdsource your baseball season experience with Beyond the Box.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Beyond the Box app combines Twitter and Instagram feeds from fans, players, teams and sportscasters. You\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re part of\u00a0the action with real time images from every Major League Baseball game. You can personalize your feed for your favorite team and get Tweets and Instagram photos from your favorite players instantly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#9. Explore all the major league ballparks past and present with Ballpark Envi.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wouldn\u2019t it\u00a0be\u00a0nice if\u00a0we\u00a0could win the lottery, quit our day jobs, and spend the season visiting all the ballparks around the country? Until you land the winning Powerball ticket, you can actually take a\u00a0virtual tour of\u00a0major league stadiums with the Ballpark Envi app. Not only do\u00a0you get access to\u00a0all the current American and National League ballparks, you can also take a\u00a0step back in\u00a0history to\u00a0see the original Yankee Stadium, Ebbets Field and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#10. Relive your childhood with the Topps\u00ae BUNT baseball card app.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Feeling nostalgic for baseball cards and a\u00a0hard stick of\u00a0gum with flavor that last for a\u00a0millisecond?
