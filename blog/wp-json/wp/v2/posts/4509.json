It addresses the simple questions of What, How and When will launch Construction into the digitalized era and increase productivity, a matter which has been of concern for many decades in the industry. Technology trends highlighted in the article are based on the JBKnowledge <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jbknowledge.com\/2017-construction-technology-report-survey\">6th Annual Construction Technology Report<\/a>,<span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">which surveyed more than 2,600 Construction leaders in the industry.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Low application of tech in Construction: reasons and constraints<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Given that the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) sector is one of the oldest industries on Earth, it is no surprise that it has been slow to adopt emerging technology. What is more surprising, there are still challenges to face when it comes to dealing with the basics:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Communication and project planning remain uncoordinated between the field and the office.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Contracts with owners often do not include shares allocated to innovation and R&amp;D.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Poor organization and decision making processes do not have the necessary response speed, and supply chain approaches are still behind other industries.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">In the McKinsey Global Institute Industry Digitization Index, the Construction industry is at the end of the list:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4525\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/01_digitalization.png\" alt=\"ar solutions\" width=\"580\" height=\"567\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/01_digitalization.png 888w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/01_digitalization-300x293.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/01_digitalization-768x751.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/01_digitalization-600x586.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/01_digitalization-450x440.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The Construction industry has yet to embrace the fact that most of the emerging digital technologies which deliver significant long-term results need up-front investment, even though innovations like AR (augmented reality)\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/602124\/augmented-reality-could-speed-up-construction-projects\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">could bring benefits to the Construction site right away<\/a>, <span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\"> according to MIT Technology Review.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">In Construction, R&amp;D and IT spendings are far behind other industries: less than 1% of revenues for R&amp;D compared to 3.5-4.5 % for the Auto and Aerospace industries, and 8% in the Telecom sector. The same numbers apply to IT resources allocation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The JBKnowledge Construction Technology report sheds light on this:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Roughly half of the respondents do not bill any IT expenditures to projects; only 31.1% bill to projects, depending on expenses. This will continue to be a problem unless key stakeholders in the construction process achieve consensus on how to quantify the ROI of technology in hours saved, efficiency created, materials not wasted, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The majority of survey participants spent less than $500,000 on any form of IT annually. Still, the number of companies spending less than 1% of annual sales on IT has decreased by 9% over the previous years. This indicates\u00a0 that more companies are realizing the value of dedicating funds to IT and the need to plan for technology upgrades.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The dependence of billing on the scale of the job was a frequent comment. This indicates that both technology vendors and AEC could benefit greatly if the pricing models would be more dependable on the job scale.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">According to McKinsey partners Jonathan Woetzel, Mukund Sridhar, and Jan Mischke, the global Construction industry has a chronic productivity problem. Over the past 20 years, productivity has grown at only 1% annually, which is around one-third of the rate of world economy and one-quarter of the rate in manufacturing. This is partially due to the low application of innovative technologies and poor implementation of them into work routines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4526\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/02_productivity-growth.png\" alt=\"augmented reality solutions\" width=\"772\" height=\"554\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/02_productivity-growth.png 1500w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/02_productivity-growth-300x216.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/02_productivity-growth-768x552.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/02_productivity-growth-1024x736.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/02_productivity-growth-600x431.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/02_productivity-growth-450x323.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/02_productivity-growth-1000x719.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Based on data from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">According to JBKnowledge annual Construction and Technology report, the low application could be explained by the following factors:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4547 \" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/employee-hesitancy_v2-1024x573.png\" alt=\"AR technology\" width=\"761\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/employee-hesitancy_v2-1024x573.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/employee-hesitancy_v2-300x168.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/employee-hesitancy_v2-768x430.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/employee-hesitancy_v2-600x336.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/employee-hesitancy_v2-450x252.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/employee-hesitancy_v2-1000x560.png 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/employee-hesitancy_v2.png 1150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee hesitancy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> factor replaced the previous year\u2019s third most prominent reason, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Management hesitancy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Presumably, this shift is a result of Construction companies\u2019 management finally seeing the value in technology (including <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR for construction)<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and R&amp;D investments. Still, since a fair amount of time has passed, the people employed in Construction are now fairly attached to their current routines and tools.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Interestingly, the survey participants who said they were willing to try everything were coming from the smallest companies surveyed (51-100 employees). Smaller companies have enough people and processes to risk trying new tech to improve efficiency. They are also more open to researching, developing, and testing new technologies \u2014 it only takes one champion to put an emerging technology on the radar at a smaller company. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, the report also outlines promising software solutions for AEC and defines the opportunities that new technologies provide, especially in the field of drone technology (the most popular emerging technology of 2017). Un<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">surprisingly,\u00a0<\/span><b>AR\u00a0 and VR<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (virtual reality) are in the <\/span><b>top 5 next-gen tech<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that construction companies are trying;\u00a0<\/span><b>AR also gained 50% in popularity<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since the previous year<\/span><b>. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One key reason for the popularity of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">augmented reality in the field of Construction<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the unprecedented potential for making huge savings on reworks:\u00a0according to Norwegian Road Authority, the average cost per change\/conflict has been calculated to be about $9600. The emerging technology allows engineers to build the right thing at the first attempt and helps to significantly improve different aspects of the construction process (you will find out about potential use cases for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">augmented reality in Construction<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> further on).<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">IT departments are growing, but are still too small<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Good construction depends on IT providing means for collaboration, coordination, and integration of input information across different departments, engineering modelling methods, and model-based analysis. This requires an established IT department which can handle all of the needs of the Construction team. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The current state of IT departments reveals that most companies do not understand the full potential and value that technology can bring to the field yet.

Respondents reported the following factors of managing the size of IT departments:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Total number of employees.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Number of technology solutions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Size of projects affecting the number of IT employees.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Though the conclusion that companies are starting to see the value in technology and establish corresponding departments to handle the implementation is clear, there is still a lot work to do in terms of aligning corporate objectives and strategy-based budgeting as a more accurate method for determining company\u2019s IT needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Benefits of cloud-based solutions for Construction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">A decade has passed since the Construction industry began using cloud solutions. How to they aid the AEC? Leveraging cloud-based services extends the possibilities for collaboration between owners, contractors and other parties; provides real time accessibility to data and cuts the need for physical storage; as well as allows to cut cost, dramatically and immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Construction companies have a long history of fearing \u201cthe cloud\u201d for security reasons. The biggest concern is the danger of data breaches (and companies providing their cloud-based solutions should address this to be competitive on the market). Some managers in the Construction industry are already beginning to see the benefits of these solutions, while others now understand that cloud-based storage is in fact <\/span><b><i>more <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">secure than on-site servers.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4529\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/05_cloud-solutions.png\" alt=\"ar technology\" width=\"580\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/05_cloud-solutions.png 592w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/05_cloud-solutions-300x205.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/05_cloud-solutions-450x308.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Going forward, more and more companies are getting to grips with the idea that cloud-based apps are more reliable in terms of uptime, security, and adding computational resources to their servers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With further growth in cloud-based solutions usage, we will see Construction companies discovering other software solutions (as well as <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">augmented reality for construction<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) that are available only in the cloud. As a result, AEC will reap many benefits and facilitate the growth of new tech startups.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">BIM usage is increasing, but it still has a long way to go<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">According JBKnowledge, roughly half of the companies feel fairly confident that they can maximize BIM (Building Information Modelling) and VDC (Virtual Design and Construction) workflows. Many companies are combining IT, BIM, and VDC departments into Construction Technology departments for closer collaboration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of engineers who do not use BIM has fallen by 30% in 2017, compared to 2016. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The net increase in BIM usage signals that more companies are dipping their toes into VDC waters (whether internally or through outsourcing) \u2014 as well as recognizing the value added in streamlining design, clash detection, and scheduling in the pre-construction process. The majority of professionals agree that BIM is the future of the AEC industry, especially as more and more owners now require BIM. However, many are still struggling to make the transition from traditional CAD to BIM, as BIM requires extensive training and significant expenses in the beginning. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further BIM expansion among companies will allow more AEC professionals to look into the emerging <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that allow the display of actual models of the buildings over the real construction site.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The main stumbling blocks for BIM adoption are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Lack of training.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Lack of understanding of the BIM ROI by the client.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Lack of resources allocated to IT.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">\u201cThe owners want BIM, but are not willing to foot the bill for it, even though it would save tons of money in labor and material,\u201d says Dan Calloway, an electrical engineer with thirty years of experience in the field. The nature of the technology will not make design teams uncomfortable, and it is only a matter of time before clients realize that BIM is a useful tool that can significantly cut business costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4549\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/how-companies-are-using-BIM_v2-1024x599.png\" alt=\"augmented reality solutions\" width=\"770\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/how-companies-are-using-BIM_v2-1024x599.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/how-companies-are-using-BIM_v2-300x176.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/how-companies-are-using-BIM_v2-768x449.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/how-companies-are-using-BIM_v2-600x351.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/how-companies-are-using-BIM_v2-450x263.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/how-companies-are-using-BIM_v2-1000x585.png 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/how-companies-are-using-BIM_v2.png 1196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Respondents also shared their opinions on where in the construction process they think BIM and VDC will add the most value in Construction in the next decade, and where both hold the greatest potential for bridging the gap between design and construction. The most common responses included: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">On-site 3D Coordination and Scheduling.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Design Review.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Existing Conditions Modeling. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Additionally, respondents highlighted wearable technologies, mobile computer connectivity, and ease of access to on-site information as areas with high perceived future value that are worth exploring further. This brings us closer to augmented reality for Construction industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Mobile and wearable devices gain traction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The Construction industry is entering the \u201cmobile revolution\u201d \u2014 mobile apps are becoming more and more popular for construction workflows. There has been a drastic shift in the usage of mobile applications and wearables since 2012 in Construction industry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The report found that the share of respondents who considered mobile tech to be unimportant has decreased roughly by 20% points. More interestingly, those who were born 1960 through 1970 responded to this question in almost the same manner as the other age groups surveyed. This means that not only millennials understand the importance of adopting the latest software. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">According to the JBKnowledge, the following numbers represent daily mobile and wearables usage through 2017:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4550\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/daily-mobile-usage_v2.png\" alt=\"augmented reality in construction industry\" width=\"770\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/daily-mobile-usage_v2.png 1002w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/daily-mobile-usage_v2-300x191.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/daily-mobile-usage_v2-768x489.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/daily-mobile-usage_v2-600x382.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/daily-mobile-usage_v2-450x287.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/daily-mobile-usage_v2-1000x637.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">While adoption of wearables has increased by 10%, most construction workers are still using their own devices (around 70% of workers).
