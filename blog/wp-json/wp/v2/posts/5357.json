Although well-made software solutions significantly improve the bottom line, elevate ERP, and simplify daily working lives of employees, you need to consider many angles and factors to make them work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When large-scale <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/enterprise-mobile-application-development-explained\/\">enterprise application development<\/a> is in question, there is a lot of room for mistakes and failure.

The solution included modules for ERP, CRM, supply chain management, and other enterprise applications. The company was positive about the enterprise app development project, saying it will introduce greater flexibility and functionality and reduce costs in the long-term. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution should have been implemented in the first part of 2008, but the rollout was cut short by Clinton Group, one of the company\u2019s shareholders. Clinton Group officials said Select Comfort exceeded the budget significantly and went behind schedule. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having been pressuring Select Comfort for months prior to this, the shareholders also called the company\u2019s leadership reckless. Select Comfort spent twelve million on the enterprise applications development project in 2007, and planned to spend eight million more in 2008; the officials at Clinton Group said the expenses were too large for the company this size. The global financial crisis that started in 2007 wasn\u2019t a reliable backdrop for such decisions either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Takeaway from the enterprise app development case<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t invest into expensive solutions when the economy is in dire state<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5359\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fighter-Jet.jpeg\" alt=\"custom enterprise application development\" width=\"664\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fighter-Jet.jpeg 808w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fighter-Jet-300x186.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fighter-Jet-768x475.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fighter-Jet-600x371.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fighter-Jet-450x278.jpeg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><b>The U.S. Air Force (Enterprise Software &amp; Enterprise Application Development)<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some projects are just too ambitious to take off.

The software development and enterprise application development efforts should have streamlined supply chain management, saving billions of dollars. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the project was overly complicated. The implementation was increasingly falling backing schedule while goals were not met.

As smartphones became ubiquitous, Skype should have followed suit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, year after year, Skype has introduced too many updates and redesigns big and small, which resulted in negative feedback (the latest redesign had caused <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/8\/6\/17657990\/microsoft-skype-7-classic-discontinuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a wide user backlash<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/820384\/estimated-number-skype-users-worldwide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">steady but slow user base growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With broken notifications and other technical problems here and there, using Skype is too often a frustrating experience across most platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some people may ignore the issues when they use Skype privately several times a week or less, Skype has eventually became a lesson on how not to do enterprise level application development. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the busy world of today, employees can\u2019t rely on a tool that is so incredibly inconsistent: one has to get used to new designs and tackle technical issues so often that Skype ultimately impedes their productivity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a time where custom enterprise application development offers immense possibilities, while other available platforms provide quick and consistent communication tools, Skype could try investing more time in long-term consistency rather than endless tweaking and experimentation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skype is not really a failure, but the app is disappointing in a major way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Takeaway from the enterprise app development case<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay consistent across platforms.

Wave should have made email threads easier to follow, ensuring almost no information is lost. For project managers with vast distributed teams, Google Wave promised to be a life-saving, stress-reducing tool. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The app allowed managers to plan discussions in stages called \u201cwaves,\u201d attaching the right users to the right wave. All this happened in a single space where everybody on the team could discuss different things simultaneously while following the overarching topic. If it sounds complex and confusing, Google Wave was just that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First and foremost, Google failed to explain what their new product was. This resulted in high expectations: many people were calling Wave the new Gmail. More so, it appears Google were also overly enthusiastic during the enterprise application development \u2014 the product skipped the MVP stage. When it launched in 2012, Wave had too many features and was too complex to use. Google shut down the project six months after the release. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Takeaway from the enterprise app development case<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convey your product clearly, especially if it aims to solve complex issues. Whether it\u2019s a startup or established enterprise, testing and gathering feedback is of topmost importance. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion <\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Custom enterprise application development is no easy task. There are always too many things to consider and control, because such solutions are mostly aimed at ERP processes for the entire company. On top of that, enterprise applications development demands substantial investments. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want your solution to succeed, always make sure you convey what it is clearly, ensure its consistency at the start and throughout the product life cycle, rely on existing frameworks if millions are at stake, and mind the economic backdrop. Finally, approach your project as thoughtfully as you can, considering as much angles and unknowns as possible.
