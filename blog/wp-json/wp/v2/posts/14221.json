Bob is CEO &amp; co-founder of Tripshare, the first mobile startup focused on building tools for collaborative travel planning. Using Tripshare<a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tripshare\/id539543106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> iPad app<\/a>, you can easily create, book and share your travel itineraries. Bob also mentioned company\u2019s plans to launch iPhone and web apps in the nearest future.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/tripshare.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tripshare<\/a> was started in 2011 &amp; has already raised 1.6 M USD of venture capital. BTW, it\u2019s ten times more than an average VC funding! As of now, Tripshare \u00a0has over 30\u00a0000 of downloads &amp; a lot of positive feedbacks from users.<\/p>\n<p>There were a lot of ups &amp; downs during these three saturated years while Tripshare was becoming a successful social sharing app. Except for the victories and losses, these three years have been full of new experiences and learning. Here they are.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson # 1: Pick your battles<\/strong><br \/>\nAssess the risks in market you want to get in. You will have to disrupt existing brands, so before starting the battle determine market size &amp; opportunities, users\u2019 needs, your messaging to consumers &amp; results you want to achieve. Choosing between content and platform battle, Tripshare decided to start with creating valuable content, and then expand to various platforms.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson #2:<\/strong> <strong>Solve big problems.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Don\u2019t focus only on making money.\u00a0 Choose your own niche in which you can bring improvements &amp; satisfy social needs. Only in this case you will succeed. BTW, 53% of people around the world still use \u201cpaper&amp;pencil\u201d planning. Tripshare is going to change this, make planning process easier &amp; better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson #3:<\/strong> <strong>Don\u2019t force it.<\/strong><br \/>\nDon\u2019t pay for customers that don\u2019t really need your product. They will come, and then they will just go away.\u00a0 30\u00a0000 downloads, 7\u00a0000 registered users, for about 1 500 active users \u2013 this is what Tripshare achieved without having paid a dime for an advertising.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson #4:<\/strong> <strong>Eliminate your doubts<\/strong><br \/>\nUse all founder contributions in your store: knowledge of technology, customer insights, previous startup experience, personal investments etc., it will help you to stand up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson #5:<\/strong> <strong>The journey is the destination<\/strong><br \/>\nEnjoy what you are doing. The process of creation must be your main focus.<br \/>\n<em>As Winston Churchill said \u201cSuccess is not final; failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts\u201d.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We really enjoyed Bob\u2019s speech, and we are looking forward to his participation in our future meetups.<\/p>\n<p>See you on our next <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SF-Mobile-Entrepreneurs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SF Mobile Entrepreneurs community<\/a> meetup that will be held in the early December!<\/p>\n<p><em>About Bob Dana<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/bobdana\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bob Dana<\/a> is CEO &amp; co-founder of Tripshare the first mobile startup focused on building tools for collaborative travel planning.
