No wonder: the raid-hailing, ride sharing app successfully simplified the way we travel around town, turning our attention to other aspects of the city life. What areas of it could be improved and simplified in a smart way? As it turns out, there are a lot of answers to the question. From next-generation car rental to on-demand office spaces and as far as to healthcare, our selection looks at apps inspired by Uber (that also can provide inspiration themselves). For this list, we look at Android (but all the apps on the list have iOS versions, too). Plus, we provide some android application development tips that would help you start with your own on-demand Android app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a look the apps and tips below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Car Rental \u2014 Fair<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5369 \" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fair-Screenshot-e1537796949176-705x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Android application development\" width=\"329\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fair-Screenshot-e1537796949176-705x1024.jpg 705w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fair-Screenshot-e1537796949176-206x300.jpg 206w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fair-Screenshot-e1537796949176-600x872.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fair-Screenshot-e1537796949176-310x450.jpg 310w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fair-Screenshot-e1537796949176-688x1000.jpg 688w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Fair-Screenshot-e1537796949176.jpg 713w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fair aims to transform car ownership by providing a quick, easy, and paperless way to get a car (the company claims their service doesn\u2019t involve loans, leases, and is not a car rental service). Everything happens in the app: you choose the vehicle you like, apply with your driver\u2019s licence and bank account information, put your signature, and then just wait for the car. Each vehicle comes with limited warranty, roadside assistance, and routine maintenance. Users can order a number of other services additionally. The design is simple, clean, and all-around eye-pleasing, with well-designed motion animations. Overall, it seems Fair has put a lot effort into Android app development for their product. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Android app development achievement<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: unclutter car catalogue<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Office Spaces \u2014 Breather<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5370 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Breather-e1537797424985.jpg\" alt=\"Android app development\" width=\"321\" height=\"484\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Breather-e1537797424985.jpg 321w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Breather-e1537797424985-199x300-1.jpg 199w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Breather-e1537797424985-298x450-1.jpg 298w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breather lets individuals, small businesses, and big brands quickly rent a distraction-free working space for an hour, day, or month.

More so, Breather\u2019s partners include high-profile companies like Apple, Airbnb, and Spotify.

Users can effortlessly book the right service, schedule their appointments up to forty-eight hours in advance, rate treatment, and other features. Providing a platform for service providers, Joiful promises the services will be delivered to the client\u2019s door in under an hour. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joiful is a cross-platform app, which allowed the company to cut costs. In some cases opting for this option is a compromise between quality and cost, but this is not the case here. The app doesn\u2019t have any complex features and its one of the most easy-to-use apps from our selection.

Like Uber, the app simplifies ordering a car as much as possible through smart design decisions and letting users track their rides in real-time. More so, Careem allows to schedule multiple rides and streamlines tipping the drivers, whom the company refers to Captains. Also, the \u201cWallet Overflow\u201d feature enables drivers to add excess cash to the wallet as credit for future journeys. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company relied on expert custom Android app development for the project: Careem has 4.6 stars on Google Play and became the regional leader in less than five years after being established in 2012 by two people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Android app development achievement: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smart multiple rides scheduling<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Moving Furniture \u2014 Buddytruk<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5373\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Buddytruk_cut.jpg\" alt=\"app development for android\" width=\"304\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Buddytruk_cut.jpg 304w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Buddytruk_cut-193x300-1.jpg 193w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Buddytruk_cut-290x450-1.jpg 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buddytruk aims at addressing a common stressful situation: moving a furniture \u00a0from destination A to B. Here\u2019s the user experience: you take a photo of a furniture item, get matched with a driver, and they deliver it while helping you to load and unload. The application\u2019s payment algorithm calculates the price based on time and mileage and is built to be budget-friendly. Like the rest of the apps in our selection, the UX ensures the entire process is simple. As for the other aspects of the moving experience, Buddytruk ensures user security and comfort by performing extensive background of the driver and their vehicle. Users are also covered with up to one million excess liability insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buddytruk isn\u2019t getting good reviews recently. Users stumble upon many different bugs and glitches that impede comfortable usage (earlier reviews are significantly more positive). Buddytruk reminds about the importance of consistency when it comes to app development for Android. When you have an on-demand service, every gear needs to work cohesively to ensure a comfortable user experience. If one of them doesn\u2019t, a business runs into the risk of losing a customer. This is all the more important in stressful tasks like moving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Android app development achievement: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">simplifying the moving process<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>FAQ<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><b>Android App Development Tips for Apps Like Uber<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Where to find Android app development companies? <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find the right Android app developers in ratings of consulting companies and research and ratings platforms. For example, the Washington-based <\/span><b>Clutch<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers comprehensive reviews and ratings by industries, platforms, cities, and more. You might find your Android application development partner there. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What to look for in your Android app developers and development partner?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Android has been around for years, so seek out companies with at least ten years of experience overall and five years in custom Android app development. An experienced company will dive deep in to your project, asking a lot of questions and doing workshops to deliver a solid app, as well as ensure its consistent operation over time. If you want deep expertise, look for an Android app development company that focuses solely on the platform. Still, mind that Android app developers working in such companies may have less expertise than multi-profile software development providers, more so when it comes to complex products. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What will be the Android app development cost for your app?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An app similar to those in our selection, and with a long feature list, will cost you at least $250,000. Still, you will have the precise cost upon finalising the key features.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to build an app like Uber?
