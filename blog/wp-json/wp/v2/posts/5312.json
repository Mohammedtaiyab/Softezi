Small and hidden, IoT devices and sensors are always out of sight, but they are the means to collect Big Data and drive impactful, enterprise-wide decision making. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeremy Rifkin, an American economic and social theorist, who has been advising the European Union and Chancellor Angela Merkel, goes as far as to brand IoT as the universal platform for for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QX3M8Ka9vUA&amp;index=10&amp;list=WL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Third Industrial Revolution<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Rifkin, humanity is currently transitioning to new forms of communication, energy, and transportation that will operate on the Internet of Things infrastructure globally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading the way are long-established large enterprises across industries that test and implement IoT solutions successfully.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s see how Amazon, Bosch, Hewlett Packard, and other big brands use enterprise IoT in our selection. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>IoT Technology Solutions: Bosch and Connected Housing<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bosch is one of Europe\u2019s largest electrotechnical and engineering firms. The company is based in Germany and produces various automotive components, manufacturing tools, diagnostics and control mechanisms, and a great many other products. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bosch\u2019s recent take on house appliances includes smart connectivity that lets gadgets \u201ctalk\u201d to each other and exchange information fast, or machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. For example, smart devices notify house owners, suppliers, or maintenance office about food shortage, electricity overuse, malfunctioning, as well as other information. In some cases, M2M devices can solve an issue on their own. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/RR4YrBbIZVI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><b>Cisco and IoT Development For Enterprise<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cisco Systems, the world&#8217;s largest network equipment producer for remote access, security services, and storage networks, also didn\u2019t miss the opportunity to leverage the Internet of Things. The company sets forth the IoT benefits for business, and offers broad-scale industrial IoT solutions that help monitor operations, gather Big Data, and optimise overarching business processes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See the video:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-oLSf0wPE0A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cisco also focuses on fog technologies, which operate between cloud services and the end user. Fog tech significantly speeds up the connection and widens the range of transmitted data. Fog tech will facilitate the adoption of IoT solutions, with 50 billion smart devices connected by 2020, according to McKinsey research. More so, fog technologies will allow for converging IT and operational technologies across organizations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Cisco\u2019s panel discussion on IoT system deployments using fog applications:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/5-a5_TiOnb0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><b>IoT Solutions in Shopping: Amazon Go<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With their Go shops, Amazon has reimagined grocery shopping by allowing customers to simply walk into the store, take the products they need, and walk out. The shops\u2019 IoT ecosystem relies on many RFID chips, CCTV cameras, and customers\u2019 smartphones connected to their Amazon accounts via a dedicated app, as well as computer vision and deep learning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The system analyzes what a customer takes and automatically adds it to their virtual cart, processing the payments for the products after they leave the store. The system is also highly responsive. For example, it can identify when a shopper took an item, but decided to put it back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, there are no queues, and the shopping experience is more pleasant, smooth, and efficient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See the video:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NrmMk1Myrxc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Go launched to general public at the start of 2018.
