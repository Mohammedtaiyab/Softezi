Sometimes, these beliefs are connected to myths; sometimes they are true.<\/p>\n<p>So, let\u2019s review the most common concerns about Android and find out if your business needs an Android presence.<\/p>\n<h3>1) Android is exotic and unfamiliar<\/h3>\n<p>The majority of our clients are iOS users, and it is the platform they see most often in their closest environment. Thus, they don\u2019t feel that anyone uses Android or that some of their customers might prefer it. Ash Rust, a co-founder of SendHub, said, \u201cUp until recently, I rarely saw anything except iPhones in people\u2019s hands.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So, if you decide to develop an app for Android, you never know what is right and what\u2019s not.<\/p>\n<p>We offer the following friendly advice to every entrepreneur who plans to run a mobile business: be familiar with 2-3 mobile platforms; it will make you more confident about UI issues.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Half of all smartphone holders use an Android device. Is it\u00a0<em>that<\/em>\u00a0few?<\/p>\n<h3>2) Android requires more development effort<\/h3>\n<p>This myth is connected to the Android fragmentation (more than 10,000 different devices are running on Android), but it doesn\u2019t take more time to deal with it. First of all, we can focus on\u00a0a limited number of devices and operating system versions. \u00a0It may seem weird, but we, mobile app developers, found out how to adjust apps for the majority of screen sizes quickly and easily.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to support all possible combinations, it\u2019s not really complicated, but inadvisable (because earlier versions of Android are really out-of-date):<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"android OS versions fragmentation \" src=\"https:\/\/stanfy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/Screen-Shot-2013-08-28-at-11.47.16-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"562\" height=\"365\" \/><em>Chart by <a href=\"http:\/\/opensignal.com\/reports\/fragmentation-2013\/\">Opensignal<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Actually, we advise supporting Android versions starting from 4.0 (for the newest devices), or, at least, 2.3<\/p>\n<h3>3) Android has poor UI and apps can\u2019t look great on it<\/h3>\n<p>Few would argue that Android looked pretty ugly for several years at the beginning. But, thanks to engineers\u2019 efforts, Android has considerably improved its UI. At the same time, the main problem that Android users face these days is the low quality of Android apps. But that isn\u2019t the platform\u2019s fault\u2014it\u2019s that developers are allowed to release apps of any quality.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4) Our target audience is not Android users<\/h3>\n<p>Nowadays, Android is so widespread that it\u2019s hard to even draw the portrait of an average user. Many former iPhone users\u00a0switched to top Android phones, but their habits have likely stayed the same.<\/p>\n<p>As Samsung is the leading Android handsets manufacturer, we could take the following\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/chart-of-the-day-iphone-buyers-versus-samsung-smartphone-buyers-2013-8\">research results<\/a>\u00a0into account: iPhone buyers are slightly younger, better educated and have a higher income than those on Samsung.<\/p>\n<p>I bet you know your customers pretty well, so simply compare this data with yours.<\/p>\n<h3>5) Android is hard to monetize<\/h3>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/04\/17\/apple-and-googles-app-stores-now-neck-and-neck-except-on-the-metric-that-matters-most-to-developers-revenue\/\">most recent data<\/a>\u00a0from the app store analytics firm App Annie shows that as of the last quarter, iOS apps earned nearly three times more revenue than those on Android. So, in general, iOS applications bring in more money.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Chart by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.distimo.com\/blog\/2013_08_top-global-apps-july-2013\/\">Distimo<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Experts see several reasons for this: Android doesn\u2019t require your credit card, smartphones in general are cheaper, and the majority of apps and services are granted for free.<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean Android is hopeless. There are savvy developers, and they profit on Android. \u00a0So you need to find the value that makes your customer want to pay for the app. The right monetization model for mobile still hasn\u2019t been found.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe <em>you\u2019ll be that savvy entrepreneur<\/em> who invents it?<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusions<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Android is rapidly spreading around the world, particularly in developing countries. This means it could take some time for it to realize its monetization potential. Look at the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.distimo.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/Total-Revenue-Apple-App-Store-and-Google-Play-July-2013-Distimo.png\">Distimo<\/a>\u00a0chart: currently, shares of revenues from iOS&#8217; App Store and Android&#8217;s Google Play are 73 percent and 27 percent, respectively. But a year before, those numbers were more like 81 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Obviously, the situation is steadily improving.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>So, do you need your business on Android? Yes, if:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>your service or product is so valuable that users are willing to pay for it, no matter it\u2019s on iOS, Android or web;<\/li>\n<li>your app has a good chance to create a new category or re-imagine the existing one; the same with countries with the fastest Android adoption (Brazil, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Russia etc.)<\/li>\n<li>your app is supposed to be free and you\u2019re using another monetization model (subscription, advertising, \u00a0in-app purchases, of just growing in users)<\/li>\n<li>your business is connected to operating with physical goods or services (e.g. Amazon, Task Rabbit, Instacart) \u2014 this eliminates the platform factor;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Experts compare the current market situation between Android and iOS to the past rivalry between Mac and Windows. Nobody knows who will win this battle. Moreover, it\u2019s hard to define victory: Windows is an absolute leader in installations, but Apple is leading in revenues.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, tough competition between iOS and Android is great for developers and users \u2014 all participants win.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At Stanfy, we communicate with different companies, from early-stage entrepreneurs to well-established businesses, and most of them don&#8217;t consider the Android platform for their app&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":63,"featured_media":14327,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[800],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Learn what are Android apps top disadvantages that make this OS less popular among entrepreneurs.
