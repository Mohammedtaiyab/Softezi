Rosen\u2019s recount of\u00a0the transpired events captures a\u00a0striking picture of\u00a0a\u00a0potentially magnificent project, skewed to\u00a0perversion by\u00a0the wants of\u00a0an\u00a0ill-informed, Pepsi-contracted \u201ccreative consultant\u201d whose apparent interests lay more in\u00a0product placement and fake drama than capturing the essence of\u00a0the show. And Matti was his name.<\/p>\n<p>Game_Jam, for those not in\u00a0the know, was planned to\u00a0be a\u00a0series that would open the world of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/game-development\">game development<\/a> up\u00a0to\u00a0global audiences, but showing viewers the dynamics of\u00a0developing a\u00a0video game from scratch. Many people in\u00a0the indie-game development world were extremely excited for a\u00a0chance to\u00a0showcase their passions\u2026but thanks to\u00a0Matti, it\u2019s gone now.<\/p>\n<p>Rosen concludes the article with a\u00a0particularly striking summary:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIt is\u00a0small companies and individuals, fighting for relevance in\u00a0a\u00a0sea of\u00a0uncertainty\u2026we need to\u00a0be\u00a0careful to\u00a0approach those people who give it\u00a0life, who make it\u00a0such a\u00a0vibrant and special place,<strong> with the respect and the space they need to\u00a0build things<\/strong> we\u00a0as\u00a0critics and fans want to\u00a0play.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The mistakes were many: from denying the developers their life blood (coffee) and insisting they plaster smiles while guzzling only Mountain Dew, to\u00a0attempting vicious drama between team members, the show was set to\u00a0fail\u2026and that says nothing of\u00a0the appalling misogyny sprinkled throughout the whole, insidious ordeal.<\/p>\n<p>But the ultimate reason for this capital failure can be\u00a0boiled down to\u00a0the fact that the producers (and subsequently Matti: the guy in\u00a0charge) did not understand who they were working with. They took no\u00a0time to\u00a0understand the values of\u00a0the participating developers and their team-mates and they made no\u00a0effort to\u00a0understand the game-development community. Simply put: their priorities were completely wrong.<\/p>\n<p>The only reason any of\u00a0these professionals agreed to\u00a0do\u00a0the show in\u00a0the first place was because of\u00a0their passion: creating games. Unfortunately none of\u00a0the producers seemed to\u00a0understand this, so\u00a0consequently: the way the show was set up (if\u00a0they managed to\u00a0shoot any of\u00a0it), the devs would have been too exhausted and annoyed to\u00a0code, and too bitter from fake to\u00a0actually do\u00a0anything productive. What\u2019s the lesson? Know your workers. Know your audience. Respect them both, or\u00a0lose them.<\/p>\n<p>Hence I\u00a0say that development is\u00a0not magic. It\u00a0may seem obvious, but to\u00a0the non-technical, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/mobile-development\">mobile apps<\/a> often feel that way. Those who do\u00a0not know how to\u00a0code, or\u00a0no\u00a0little about it, an\u00a0app is\u00a0as\u00a0simple as\u00a0a\u00a0fun idea and some pretty pictures.<\/p>\n<p>While having a\u00a0concrete list of\u00a0requirements for what you want in\u00a0your app may be\u00a0a\u00a0great start, you need to\u00a0come with a\u00a0fundamental understanding that computer programs are guided by\u00a0rules and those rules carry inherent restrictions.<\/p>\n<p>Often times, clients try to\u00a0put undue pressure on\u00a0a\u00a0development workforce because they don\u2019t understand the reality of\u00a0what mobile software development entails. Here are some things that, as\u00a0a\u00a0client, you should understand:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is\u00a0no\u00a0such thing as\u00a0bug-free software;<\/li>\n<li>Estimates are precisely that: estimates (sometimes they are less accurate than other times);<\/li>\n<li>Not everything you can think of\u00a0is\u00a0possible;<\/li>\n<li>The final product is\u00a0the developers\u2019 interpretation of\u00a0the analysts\u2019 interpretation of\u00a0the clients\u2019 portrayal of\u00a0his vision: it\u00a0may look different than you (the client) imagined.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If\u00a0you do\u00a0not respect the passions of\u00a0your development workforce, then you will fail to\u00a0respect them; they will disengage and the result will be\u00a0an\u00a0inferior product. Matti\u2019s mistakes all boiled down to\u00a0this principle: he\u00a0did not understand the people he\u00a0was trying to\u00a0manage. Matti\u2019s goals were corporate sponsorship, product placement, and ratings\u2014the developers\u2019 goals were gaming. Understand that, although they may wear jeans to\u00a0work, play a\u00a0lot of\u00a0video games, and maybe even collect action figures, developers are professionals. They take pride in\u00a0what they do\u00a0and often times they do\u00a0it\u00a0well. They are worthy of\u00a0your respect.<\/p>\n<p>Had Matti been more mindful of\u00a0the teams\u2019 interests, and more respectful to\u00a0the developers, then Game_Jam would not have failed. In\u00a0fact, I\u2019m certain that they could have found innovative ways to\u00a0reach the audience, engage the passions of\u00a0the devs, and appease the corporate sponsors. Everyone could have been happy\u2014but Matti didn\u2019t take them seriously. He\u00a0failed to\u00a0respect them.<\/p>\n<p>Never make the mistake of\u00a0believing that because you\u2019re paying someone money, that it\u00a0gives you power over them: if\u00a0you fail to\u00a0see beyond your own interests, (as\u00a0Matti did) then everyone loses.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The quicker you learn this, the better your product will be\u2014for you shall be a better client.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":63,"featured_media":3270,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 -
