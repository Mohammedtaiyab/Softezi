BABB and Intellectsoft will deliver an alpha app for private (community) release in Q4 2018, followed by beta testing and refinement with a public release in Q1 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BABB is one of London\u2019s most ambitious and innovative fintech companies, headquartered at the Level39 technology accelerator in Canary Wharf. BABB\u2019s proposition uses technologies including blockchain and facial and voice recognition to tackle financial exclusion; increase access to banking; and promote speed, security and data privacy in financial services.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Development Work Dialed Up<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work on the BABB app and platform began in March 2018 and BABB\u2019s partnership with Intellectsoft is the latest stride in its progress towards delivering its mobile app and payment card on time. For over a decade Intellectsoft has been helping enterprise clients, funded startups, and Fortune 500 companies from all major industries embrace challenges of Digital Transformation through implementation of new and emerging technologies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this year, Intellectsoft announced the launch of the Blockchain Lab \u2014 an enterprise-grade blockchain consulting and development unit that consolidates Intellectsoft\u2019s experience in the distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and connects an extensive pool of engineering, cryptography, and cybersecurity talents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commenting on the new partnership, BABB CEO Rushd Averroes stated: \u201cthe BABB project is technically ambitious. We now have an entire team of people at Intellectsoft who are dedicated to this project and who have the capability to support us. This partnership will assist us with a thoughtful step by step delivery of the app to make the BABB vision a reality\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe are excited about this partnership with BABB. Unlike many companies operating in the emerging blockchain space these days, our colleagues at BABB are approaching the fundamental aspects of the platform design, such as security and scalability, very seriously\u201d, notices Intellectsoft CEO Michael Minkevich. \u201cIt is an interesting and technologically challenging project. We are looking forward to helping our new partners deliver this innovative product that will open access to the next generation of banking services to millions of people around the globe\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>App Launch Targets Committed<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The partnership reaffirms BABB\u2019s commitment to hit the target launch dates which were set in early 2018. The news will be met with enthusiasm by BABB\u2019s engaged and growing community of over 50,000 early supporters from all over the world. Following the private release in Q4 2018, this audience base will form a team of beta testers ahead of the public app launch in Q1 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The app will showcase a range of features including the ability to open an entry-level account using just face and voice recognition, make payments to any other bank account and make instantaneous peer-to-peer transactions within the platform.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BABB is concurrently working to obtain a UK banking license with the aim of becoming the first regulated blockchain-based bank in the UK. In order to fund the minimum capital requirement for the license, BABB is raising money through an equity crowdsale which is live now.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>About BABB<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BABB is the World Bank for the microeconomy; a decentralised banking platform that leverages blockchain, AI, and biometrics technologies to offer anyone in the world access to a bank account for peer-to-peer financial services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 2 billion people in the world without a bank account, and it\u2019s not viable for the traditional banking system to serve them.
