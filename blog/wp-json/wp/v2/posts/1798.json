What is surprising, however, is that the 100 largest hospitals in the U.S. have collectively <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.accenture.com\/t20151112T042615__w__\/us-en\/_acnmedia\/Accenture\/Conversion-Assets\/DotCom\/Documents\/Global\/PDF\/Dualpub_24\/Accenture-Losing-Patience.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">engaged fewer than 2% of patients through mobile apps<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This disparity has not necessarily come from a lack of effort. Two-thirds of the hospitals analyzed by Accenture do have some form of consumer-facing mobile app &#8212; though fewer than 40% of those offerings came through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/enterprise-development\">custom development<\/a>. The real failing seems to lie in their feature selection. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Patients have consistently cited access to medical records, appointment scheduling and prescription refill requests as their top-three most desired medical app capabilities. According to Accenture, the hospital apps achieved that functionality in 11%, 8% and 6% of cases, respectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Disruptive App Developers Stand To Profit<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As large, traditional healthcare providers struggle to craft effective mobile apps, small, disruptive point solutions are gaining ground. By focusing on the attractive designs and intuitive tools that patients have come to expect from publishers in other app categories, apps like ZocDoc and iTriage are scoring consistent downloads and winning five-star ratings from patients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these independent apps aren\u2019t necessarily going toe-to-toe with hospitals in terms of clinical service delivery, they could be cutting into profits by exacerbating patient dissatisfaction. With separate studies reporting that 7% of patients have switched healthcare providers on account of poor customer experiences, Accenture analysts concluded that a similar churn rate would translate to more than $100 million in revenue lost annually per hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Whether hospitals decide that they\u2019re capable of correcting course internally, or need to start partnering with outside vendors, successful solutions will likely stem from a very similar philosophy. By deliberately and consistently incorporating user feedback into the app development process, providers will significantly increase their odds of capturing customer loyalty.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, in effect, the disruption that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/industries\/healthcare-solutions\">healthcare industry<\/a> needs may merely be a renewed commitment to agile development fundamentals.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Consumer healthcare has the potential to become the most impactful arena for mobile app
