Today, we already witness an incredible power of the pandemic: disrupted workforces, supply chains, worldwide economic activity, and more to come in months. But what is it really: chaos or new opportunities for organizations to become more flexible and improve their business continuity management plans?<\/p>\n<p>The reality is that every crisis or disaster sooner or later has both immediate and long-term implications of how businesses operate and impact society. So, it is with a sense of urgency that organizations should refer to their decades-long <b>IT business continuity plans<\/b><b> to ensure their operational and strategic resilience and agility.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Leaders (and not only them) are making rapid, highly-informed decisions. They should take immediate action to protect and support their workforce and ensure that all business operations continue in order to help business and societal continuities.

Current disruptions to the workforce (as a result of remote working) requires workplace elasticity and business processes flexibility.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19200\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/man-laptop-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"remote work from home\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1709\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/man-laptop-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/man-laptop-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/man-laptop-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/man-laptop-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/man-laptop-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/man-laptop-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/man-laptop-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/man-laptop-450x300.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/man-laptop-1000x667.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;it business continuity and disaster recovery&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:3700253},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}\">IT business continuity and disaster recovery<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>To minimize business disruption and protect employees from consequences of threats, organizations should have not only a profound pandemic plan for business continuity but also be able to emerge from one of the most surreal moments of the recent memory.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the <b>three most essential foundations leaders should pay attention to<\/b> today:<\/p>\n<p>1. Empowering workforce and building a digital workplace<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>A<\/b><b>nalyze your current technology capabilities<\/b>, including a communications plan and support structure. It\u2019s essential to keep leadership and employees aware of current fundamental changes;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Examine your ability to scale out internally.<\/b> Make sure that digital workplaces enable your people to work remotely through digital collaboration tools;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Start cultivating a digital culture and shifting to the mindset of collaboration.<\/b> Undoubtedly, your employees will require additional skills around the new way of working.

Serving your customers\u2019 core needs<\/p>\n<p>Businesses adapt to serve customers through uncertainty. This, of course, means organizations are increasingly thinking out of the box to find creative ways to continue working with clients smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>Highly extendable workplace environments allow organizations <b>to adapt to changing business needs based on global conditions.<\/b> Moreover, being extremely transparent in communication, operations, and engagements \u2014 is key to a successful transition from unpredictability to trusted relationships.<\/p>\n<p>3. Establishing business continuity planning steps<\/p>\n<p>While no systems can perfectly anticipate every contingency, ensuring that all business units are supported, informed, and protected as much as possible, can greatly untie your hands to develop new business processes. This means continuing to work while adapting to the new IT business continuity plan, ways of collaborating, and decision-making. But what is more important \u2014 to conduct additional disaster testing scenarios in parallel with operational work.<\/p>\n<h3>Six steps for businesses\u2019 quick reaction<\/h3>\n<p>Today enterprises recognize the need to respond effectively to disruptions caused by factors outside their control.

Distributed Agile Teams: a New Way to Deliver at Scale<\/h2>\n<p>At Intellectsoft, we have worked with distributed teams for many years now. Lowering costs while increasing the pace of business \u2014 is no easy task. But it seems to be quite effective and allows for even greater potential benefits if implemented correctly.<\/p>\n<p>Distributed agile teams require more communication and touchpoints. On the other hand, they can bring productivity and speed traditional teams simply cannot. Moreover, communication tools, project management approaches, and planning processes are improving all the time, leaving more space for collaboration and consistency.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being thousands of kilometers apart, every employee interacts with the same board, is able to track the overall progress, and share lessons learned. During turbulent times like today\u2019s one, it is just one of a few reliable ways your company can continually improve the work in a long-term perspective and improve business continuity strategy for the years to come.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-19198 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/girl-iphone-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"remote work with seamless connectivity\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1709\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/girl-iphone-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/girl-iphone-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/girl-iphone-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/girl-iphone-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/girl-iphone-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/girl-iphone-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/girl-iphone-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/girl-iphone-450x300.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/girl-iphone-1000x667.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>4.
