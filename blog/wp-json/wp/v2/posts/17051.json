They included in-house lawyers\u2019 greater demands on firms, pressure to cut costs, lack of standardization in client procurement across departments, attracting and charging clients in the competitive market after the recession, as well as competition from new companies that rejected the traditional law model. On top of that, law firms needed to plow through vast amounts of data since email communication has started becoming the new normal in the industry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years, legaltech has grown to encompass, on the one hand, the software and technology tools that simplify and streamline law practice for lawyers, and on the other, digital tools that simplify the acquisition and management of law services for clients by reducing or eliminating the need to consult a lawyer (or making it easier to find the right one quickly).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Technologies &amp; Application Areas<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a higher level, legaltech is the industry\u2019s way of performing digital transformation, that is, using software and technologies to simplify operations, become leaner, cater to modern customers, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legaltech encompasses the following software solutions and technologies:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workflow software tools<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning (AI\/ML) algorithms<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analytics &amp; big data software tools<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer experience (CX) solutions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud technology<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Distributed ledger technology (DLT)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Legaltech Areas<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI\/ML document review \u2013 data-trained algorithms that analyze legal documents across many areas, from risk management to M&amp;A to compliance cases.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Document and contract management platforms \u2014 tools that streamline or automate creating templates, negotiating clauses, and analyzing content.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workflow tools \u2013 systems that allow lawyers to digitalise and automate their workflows.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart contracts \u2013 self-executing clauses in legal contracts enabled by DLT, Internet of Things (IoT), and other.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-discovery tools \u2014 solutions that simplify and automate e-discovery stages, for example machine learning algorithms that collect and process documents and prepare it for a lawyer to review.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legal chatbots \u2013 automated rule-based tools enabled by AI\/ML that allow users to get answers to basic legal inquiries in a chat or messenger.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online marketplaces \u2014 digital platforms that help clients find the right lawyer faster.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud-based databases \u2014 data is gathered in a single data warehouse, where it can be accessed by employees across departments.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data security \u2014 ensuring the highest level of security for legal records with DLT.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Legaltech vs Lawtech \u2014 What Is the Difference?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@thelawboutiquelondon\/is-there-a-difference-between-lawtech-and-legaltech-68f776d5ab98\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some experts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reckon legaltech and lawtech serve different purposes, with the first referring to software and technologies lawyers use to streamline their work (e-discovery, AI\/ML document review), and the second encompassing products for their clients (legal chabots, online marketplaces). <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.legalgeek.co\/learn\/lawtech-legaltech-wtf\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other lawyers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reckon lawtech is not a fitting name for the field, as it implies the subject of law in general rather than an industry. In different publications, lawtech and legaltech are used interchangeably, but legaltech more often still. As of now, using both makes equal sense; time will tell which of terms will stick.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Use Cases: What Legaltech Benefits Firms Can Expect<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While legal tech is a nascent field, law firms are already leveraging what it has to offer, digititalizing their workflows, improving customer experiences, helping clients to return virtual money, and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Big Data &amp; Cloud \u2014 M&amp;A &amp; Portfolio Management<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for a way to review large patent portfolios, lawyers from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/87dd18d2-94bd-11e8-95f8-8640db9060a7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bird &amp; Bird<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have teamed up with their client Nokia (the technology company) and a range of experts from different fields for a solution. Their joint effort resulted in Pattern \u2014 a cloud-based big data tool that simplifies M&amp;As and client portfolio management and includes details of every patent ever published. The tool proved efficient and was rolled out to Bird &amp; Bird\u2019s clients in 2017.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Mobile \u2014 Workflow &amp; Document Management\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of our clients, a long-established U.S. law firm, needed to transfer their workflows and document management as well as minimize the heavy paperwork common to a law firm.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A comprehensive and handy mobile app proved to be the fitting solution. It empowered the firm\u2019s lawyers with the following features:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediate access to \u0441ritical legal documents; files and documents can be securely shared between the firm\u2019s lawyers<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attorneys can send bills and receive payments easily<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HR center with powerful employee management tools<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notification center: clients and lawyers are always notified about changes and updates<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White Label solution<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence Document Analysis<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to free the legal industry from the massive amounts of paperwork. A good example comes from Luminance \u2014 an AI platform for due diligence, insurance, contract, and compliance management. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.techworld.com\/picture-gallery\/startups\/uks-leading-lawtech-startups-3680397\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">platform<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses computer vision, machine learning (ML) algorithms, and probability statistics to analyze documents much quicker than a human. Since it launch in 2015, the AI platform gained wide recognition among law firms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Customer Experience Management<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CX platforms can make a big difference in a legal firm\u2019s operations. In one of our projects, we helped a U.S. law firm fully digitalize their legal consulting with such a platform. It consists of two parts. Customers use a mobile app to request legal help by creating tickets with basic information and attached documents. On the other side, the firm\u2019s representatives and employees are assigned with tickets in a web-based interface with a simple workflow (in style of JIRA) to manage those requests. If the representative cannot address the issue, it is automatically passed further to the firm\u2019s in-house experts. The platform also gathers data, accumulating a knowledge base to simplify the process of solving similar issues in the future for every representative and in-house lawyer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Illegal Transactions Tracking with DLT<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the legal industry heavily relies on tradition, it already started leveraging what distributed ledger technology (DLT) has to offer. Josias Dewey, a partner at Holland &amp; Knight and a software engineer, helps the firm\u2019s clients create DLT proof-of-concepts applications. For example, he helped develop a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/68811bac-f262-11e8-9623-d7f9881e729f\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DLT tool<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that helps track and freeze illegal virtual currency transactions, helping a client to return $500,000 lost as the result of a hack.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out how legaltech can help your firm become more effective. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/contacts\">Schedule a consultation with our experts<\/a>. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Everything you need to know about the current state of legaltech.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":63,"featured_media":17052,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[798,2,13],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Find out what legaltech is, where your firm can use it, what technologies are involved, and more.
