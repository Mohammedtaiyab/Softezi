According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2018-10-17-gartner-says-global-it-spending-to-grow-3-2-percent-in-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Gartner report<\/a>, worldwide IT spending with a total of $3.8 trillion in 2019 is only expected to increase in 2020. At the same time, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/190122\/total-gloabl-contract-value-information-technology-outsourcing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Statista<\/a> estimated the revenue of the global outsourcing industry to be $92.5 billion dollars in 2019, as well as predicting the rapid rise in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>These figures are the embodiment of limitless emerging technologies potential. Following all the latest innovations, the majority of businesses have already embraced the inevitability of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/digital-transformation-services\">digital transformation<\/a>. Having this in mind, ventures of all sizes are keeping an eye on prevalent software development outsourcing trends.<\/p>\n<p>Outsourcing is shaping the global market, revolutionizing the way companies perceive their development, and bringing unrivaled opportunities to seize. That is why we have singled out ten trends in outsourcing software development in the unprecedented times of 2020. So get ready for all the hype your company can benefit from.<\/p>\n<h2>Software Development Outsourcing Trends: What to Expect in 2020<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>The Rise of Narrowly Specialized Boutique Software Companies\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The opinions may differ: some say they\u2019d prefer dealing with one outsourcing company. Others claim they enjoy the advantages of multiple vendors. Still, the facts show that more and more businesses find themselves in need of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/articles\/software-it-outsourcing-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">narrow specialization companies<\/a>. The reason behind this trend is the fast-evolving tech area. It is impossible to have an in-house team able to keep up with all the innovation appearing every day and thus possessing all the needed skills. Companies are looking for outsourcing providers skilled to bring the maximum quality, and the necessity to collaborate with more than just one vendor isn\u2019t a problem, as long as the desired results will be achieved. However, if a large outsourcing company offers a full-cycle software development with a diverse team of skilled professionals, it will as well have a severe advantage being a great vendor to create strong transparent relationships.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Customers Will Crave Enhanced Experience with AI and IoT<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Online shopping has long penetrated our daily lives. In addition to that, with the COVID-19 outbreak, it has become the new normal according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/blakemorgan\/2020\/04\/27\/customer-experience-mindset-in-a-post-covid-19-world-an-infograph\/#4b7cd2323d0e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forbes<\/a>, and even the age category of 65+ are saying they are likely to buy more online than offline. The rising demand for online buying experience causes companies to invest more in enhanced User Experience (UX).

The solutions with AI and IoT capabilities will enhance e-commerce by offering a more personalized customer journey. AI-Powered Chatbots are already substituting human interactions when providing clients with needed guidance and advice. The recent Gartner report claims that 85% of clients will be ordering items or services with no human contact. <a href=\"https:\/\/us.epsilon.com\/pressroom\/new-epsilon-research-indicates-80-of-consumers-are-more-likely-to-make-a-purchase-when-brands-offer-personalized-experiences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">80% of customers <\/a>prefer companies with personalized client experience to those that don\u2019t offer it. IoT will be one of the means of improving customer satisfaction by providing real-time data, gathering statistics to personalize communication, and detecting problems with equipment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20929\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Brazil-USA-Travelers.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil Travelers 2020\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Brazil-USA-Travelers.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Brazil-USA-Travelers-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Brazil-USA-Travelers-450x281.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/research.g2.com\/insights\/google-improves-search-results-by-leveraging-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Image courtesy of Google<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>High Demand for Blockchain Services<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Global Blockchain spendings are predicted to reach <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/800426\/worldwide-blockchain-solutions-spending\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$16 billion annually by 2023<\/a>. They were thus making it one of the leading IT outsourcing trends. From developing smart contracts to immediate microtransactions &#8211; distributed ledger technology has proven to enhance security, transparency, and offer innovative money-raising solutions for startups. Since the demand for knowledgeable and capable blockchain service is increasing, so is the need for well-seasoned specialists. These days there is still a shortage of blockchain professionals. That is why a wide range of industries, from financial institutions to private ventures, are seeking to outsource companies with a well-experienced team of blockchain experts. Facing an increased need for blockchain talent as well as its scarcity, companies are competing to hire the best among equals.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>A Growing Need for Increased Cybersecurity<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/leaders\/2017\/05\/06\/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Data has long become the most valuable resource<\/a>. It\u2019s no news. However, this is the reason why its protection has never been as crucial as it is today.

The demand now is to have all the data well-secured. Especially when governmental institutions become the victims of cyberattacks. Whether it\u2019s an IT company or a small-sized family business with a website, owners will be reached outsourced cybersecurity services to eliminate any security concerns, guard their business data, and meet compliance standards of GDPR.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20931\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Outsourcing-Market-Trends.jpg\" alt=\"Outsourcing Market 2020\" width=\"836\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Outsourcing-Market-Trends.jpg 836w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Outsourcing-Market-Trends-300x224.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Outsourcing-Market-Trends-768x572.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Outsourcing-Market-Trends-600x447.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Outsourcing-Market-Trends-450x335.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 836px) 100vw, 836px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/nl\/Documents\/operations\/deloitte-nl-s&amp;o-global-outsourcing-survey.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source: Deloitte<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Booming Global Cloud Computing Market<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another prediction by many sources, as well as Gartner, reports, says that the demand for cloud computing will only be rising.

Companies who don\u2019t want to fall behind are already investing their time and money into digital transformation. Still, there are several challenges. One of which is the speed of innovation. While even huge companies having well-equipped teams cannot keep up with the pace and are in dire need of outsourcing specialists, companies of smaller size neither can embrace all the digital changes without a supporting outsourcing team.<\/p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t use the words \u2018teams\u2019 by mistake. One of the critical software development outsourcing trends is indeed a strategic partnership with more than one vendor. Companies are facing a shortage of talent pool and have to contract out specialists.<\/p>\n<p>However, despite building relationships with more than one outsource company, there is and will be a significant shift like these relationships. The high demand for outsourcing help will make such collaborations more transparent and interpersonal. Furthermore, companies are focusing on value rather than lower costs. For this reason, it will be a common practice to collaborate with multiple vendors, each specializing in particular services.<\/p>\n<p>Summing up, to keep up with the times, and to meet quality standards 2020 will dictate, businesses will be looking for outsource partners to share risks and together create better value. We, at Intellectsoft, empower companies and their workforce with cutting-edge transformative solutions and data-driven insights.
