Trust makes for better vendor-client relationships, and in\u00a0turn, more clients.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So\u00a0why isn\u2019t everyone always transparent, then? Simple: because people are bad communicators.<\/p>\n<p>Do\u00a0you remember <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/staffing\">developers<\/a> before they were rich and cool? We\u00a0called them \u2018geeks\u2019, \u2018nerds\u2019, \u2018dweebs\u2019, and \u2018dorks\u2019. The reason for this was that their interests in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/technological-services\">technology<\/a> and figuring out how things work far outweighed their interest in\u00a0social etiquette. They saw it\u00a0as\u00a0pointless, and this has had a\u00a0lasting effect on\u00a0many individuals who program: they\u2019re either unwilling or\u00a0unable to\u00a0explain the processes that, to\u00a0them, seem very logical and obvious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Temptation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of\u00a0course this isn\u2019t a\u00a0bad thing\u2014it simply reaffirms the need for business analysts and project managers who know how to\u00a0communicate with clients. But have you ever tried to\u00a0translate tech-speak to\u00a0a\u00a0client? A\u00a0lot of\u00a0times it\u00a0has\u2026less than desirable results. Sometimes, greater transparency causes only more frustration for the client and we\u00a0are tempted by\u00a0the thought that it\u00a0would have much been better had we\u00a0simply delivered the product and limited the customer\u2019s perspective. The client, the company, and the developers would all be\u00a0satisfied.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Reality<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But really things don\u2019t work out so\u00a0nicely. And a\u00a0fixed presentation at\u00a0one point may lead into some tough questions later\u00a0on.<br \/>\nAgile software development methodology puts the Product Owner in\u00a0the metaphorical driver\u2019s seat of\u00a0the project. He\u00a0calls the ultimate shots on\u00a0the project because, well, he\u2019s paying for\u00a0it. It\u00a0makes sense. The problem we\u00a0incur, however, is\u00a0that most product owners are non-technical people, and their understanding of\u00a0development processes and the limitations of\u00a0computer programming are almost slim-to-none.<br \/>\nWhile there is\u00a0an\u00a0element of\u00a0truth to\u00a0this, most clients are not completely oblivious to\u00a0the challenges of\u00a0producing a\u00a0high-quality product within a\u00a0given budget, and they\u2019re fully capable of\u00a0understanding the hiccups that happen along the way. Being transparent really isn\u2019t so\u00a0bad after all!<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Benefits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When the client is\u00a0actively involved in\u00a0the product-building process, they see in\u00a0almost-real-time the development of\u00a0any possible holes, bottlenecks, and problems that might incur with the way the software is\u00a0being developed. Instead of\u00a0having to\u00a0wait for the end of\u00a0a\u00a0sprint to\u00a0see the problem, they can immediately bring it\u00a0to\u00a0the attention of\u00a0the project manager, and so\u00a0a\u00a0resolution process can begin.<\/p>\n<p>Just as\u00a0developers often have difficulty communicating ideas to\u00a0non-technical people, clients don\u2019t always understand the implications of\u00a0the requests that they make. The client, for example may retain certain necessary bits of\u00a0information that they deem unimportant or\u00a0that, in\u00a0their mind, will not affect the outcome of\u00a0the product. But increased transparency and regular communication will bring these issues to\u00a0light substantially sooner and help avoid redundant development. Talking things through helps trigger ideas about the way the entire software package fits together and prompts various parties to\u00a0raise more questions: resulting in\u00a0clarity.<\/p>\n<p>Developers will benefit as\u00a0well: complete transparency doesn\u2019t simply mean \u201ctransparency to\u00a0the customer.\u201d Transparency also applies to\u00a0code, so\u00a0that at\u00a0any given time, anyone involved in\u00a0the project can see what the individual is\u00a0working\u00a0on. When all members of\u00a0the team understand who\u2019s working on\u00a0what, they can offer their insight to\u00a0help solve problems together and greatly increase the efficiency of\u00a0development. An\u00a0experienced developer may be\u00a0able to\u00a0solve a\u00a0problem in\u00a0a\u00a0few minutes, whereas a\u00a0junior developer may have been struggling with it\u00a0for several days.<\/p>\n<p>Managers benefit from transparency because of\u00a0their role as\u00a0the bi-directional channel of\u00a0communication between developers and clients. They are a\u00a0messenger to\u00a0both parties, often bearing bad news\u2026so they need as\u00a0much information as\u00a0possible. Managers bridge the technical and non-technical worlds in\u00a0order to\u00a0facilitate the best possible solutions for all stakeholders. The more the manager understands both sides, the better he\u00a0can communicate needs and anticipate (and subsequently neutralize) potential bottlenecks while mitigating problems.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So\u00a0if\u00a0Everybody Benefits, Why is\u00a0it\u00a0Still so\u00a0Tough?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Because we\u00a0don\u2019t like to\u00a0do\u00a0it all the way. Drawing back on\u00a0the temptation described above, we\u00a0want to\u00a0be\u00a0somewhat transparent, but we\u2019re also tempted to\u00a0try and hide certain information and smooth the process without letting the client worry about it (and ultimately complain about it).<\/p>\n<p>In\u00a0a\u00a0similar vein, at\u00a0the end of\u00a0the day, clients, managers, and developers are all different stakeholders\u2014and each one has their own interests. Sometimes those interests conflict (i.e. the client wants to\u00a0save money, the vendor wants to\u00a0make money), but transparency helps every party compromise.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transparency Means Transparency<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If\u00a0we\u00a0implement complete transparency in\u00a0a\u00a0project, then it\u00a0puts the client in\u00a0the driver\u2019s seat and sets the vendor as\u00a0the advisor. This is\u00a0good for everyone: when the client has more control, then they are ready and aware to\u00a0take total responsibility for the project\u2014for good or\u00a0for bad.<br \/>\nIn\u00a0the advisor role, the vendor is\u00a0free to\u00a0offer as\u00a0many possible solutions as\u00a0necessary and even their recommendations, but it\u00a0is\u00a0ultimately the decision of\u00a0the client to\u00a0take that advice. Understanding specific roles is\u00a0an\u00a0entirely different story, but one thing is\u00a0for sure: the more everyone knows about the project, the better the final product will\u00a0be.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In theory it sounds great: \u201cMore transparency means better production and happier clients.\u201d The reasoning, we argue, is that transparency builds trust.
