Although, the process is slower than compared to digital transformation in banking, for instance. There is a chance to learn more from experience in other industries and even accelerate the process in healthcare based on the available results.<\/p>\n<p>The core aim behind digital transformation is to create more customer-centered services, and it will be of great importance in healthcare as the treatment of every patient can become more personalized, thus making it better for the patients.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Digital Transformation In Healthcare Industry: New Era For The Society\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Healthcare digital transformation could be a great breakthrough for the medical industry. The implementation of the right solutions will bring a lot of advantages, and some diseases could be cured more effectively and much quicker.<\/p>\n<p>Some companies have already started to use technologies for the benefit of the healthcare industry. Here are some of the examples.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Is Digital Transformation In Healthcare?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Digital transformation in healthcare is not only about technologies but, to be more precise, it\u2019s rather about the way to use available tools, software, technologies, etc. to get the most from it for the sake of people\u2019s health. Like any other sphere that is influenced by digital transformation, the healthcare industry puts patients at the center. It means that all the efforts will be put into the enhancement of treatment quality, better analysis, and medicine selection to cure a particular disease.<\/p>\n<p>The transformation has a lot of benefits for all the parties involved, as technologies allow us to work more effectively. Now medical centers and huge healthcare enterprises have to rethink their business strategies and build the way to more opportunities that come with transformation. So, what are the top benefits of digitalization in the healthcare field?<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Digital Transformation Examples In Healthcare<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Although nowadays, the digital transformation in the healthcare industry is on a rather slow path in comparison with tech, financial, manufacture, and other industries. But still, we have a chance to take advantage of some of the innovations. For instance, heart rate trackers that are installed on wearables (fitness trackers, smartwatches) provide important data and can prevent heart attacks, provide health recommendations to the users as they are synced with smartphone apps. One of the examples is the Apple smartwatch that sends alerts once someone experiences atrial fibrillation.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19368\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry-.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Healthcare Solutions that Enhance Industry\" width=\"660\" height=\"260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry-.jpg 660w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry-300x118-1.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry-600x236-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry-450x177-1.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another bright example of the use of digital technologies in medicine is a company BostonGene. The company uses biomedical software to analyze patients\u2019 disease history to help doctors prescribe the right treatment according to the patient&#8217;s genetics to fight cancer more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Devices and solutions like this are going to make a great impact on the healthcare field in every country, providing more efficient treatment, better process organization, and reducing costs.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Top Benefits Of Digital Transformation In Healthcare<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Better Services for Patients<br \/>\n<\/strong>Healthcare, like any other industry that steps on the path to digital transformation, is patient(customer)-centred. The implementation of numerous technologies will give a chance to make treatment more personalized (as we can see from the examples mentioned above). The individual approach is always better than following common recommendations that might not work in some cases.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Better Analysis<br \/>\n<\/strong>The use of such technologies as AI or ML gives opportunities to analyze data effectively and much quicker than people can do. Also, these technologies minimize mistakes, thus improving staff productivity.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Better Organization<br \/>\n<\/strong>Thanks to Cloud computing and other digital tools, all the data could be digitalized. It allows quick access to medical records that give doctors a chance to make decisions effectively and provide more profound treatment. In addition to this, wearable devices could alert both patients and doctors in case of emergency in call the ambulance automatically.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Better Time Management<br \/>\n<\/strong>The implementation of different digital solutions into the healthcare field saves a lot of valuable time. This is how numerous lives could be saved when we have, for instance, a 24\/7 connection with medical staff.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Better Environment for Doctors<br \/>\n<\/strong>The technologies enable access to a large amount of data; they provide better communication and could provide important information for the research. More profound research that doctors could make results in better treatment and leads us to the first benefit in our list, better services for the patients.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><strong>Digital Healthcare: Trends, Solutions, And Technologies Used\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Although digital transformation concentrates more on advantages for the patients and medical staff, still technologies and solutions are the tools that enable this process. What are they?<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Digital Healthcare Solutions That Enhance Industry<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Digital healthcare is a rather new field, but thanks to the experience of some developed countries, now we can take advantage of the following solutions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make online doctor appointments;<\/li>\n<li>create electronic medical records;<\/li>\n<li>create unified platforms for data exchange;<\/li>\n<li>use chatbots to provide necessary information online (while a patient is checking the website);<\/li>\n<li>use electronic medical cards that contain all patients\u2019 medical records and prescribed medications, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are numerous ways where software solutions can be used in healthcare in order to enhance the national medical industry.
