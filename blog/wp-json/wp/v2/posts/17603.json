For an enterprise app to succeed and be used properly and efficiently, every company needs to create a manual or training program (depending on the complexity of the application).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>App size optimization<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 The size of an enterprise app size should be too big, whether your company has a Bring Your Own Device policy, or provides employees with smartphones. An enterprise app also should not have redundant or rarely used features that increase its size.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Branding<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 An enterprise app should reflect the company\u2019s image in its design. This means recurrent usage of the company\u2019s logo on different screens, using corporate colors in the design, and employing the elements of the visual corporate style throughout the app.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>User experience<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 A major thing that an enterprise app development team needs to address is the user experience. The developers and designers should closely listen to what the audience wants and needs to ensure that the final product cover all requirements and is comfortable to use. The ultimate goal of an enterprise app, like any other app is to make the users\u2019 life easier.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Application security<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 An enterprise app will inevitably store sensitive corporate data, so the software development team that is building your app should ensure that data is secure at all times by deploying several available methods at once.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Powerful &amp; focused content<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 The app should only focus on and meet the unique set of requirements that prompted its development. Enterprise mobile applications should be simple and aim at solving specific issues (but not too many at once) and provide a team with the tools that help, not impede their workflow.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Iterative design<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 Nowadays, developers prefer the agile development process, with which they are enabled to constantly update their app based on client feedback instead of showing the final result and gathering feedback after. As parts of an enterprise app\u2019s design or functionality may turn out not as the client expected, the developers can make use of this software development approach to fine-tune the app without compromising quality, performance, the final outcome.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Smart sensors<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 With technology progressing at an exciting speed, it is important for enterprises to stay ahead of the competition and incorporate some of the most effective technologies into the concept of their enterprise app. Things that enterprises can leverage include AI driven voice control options, leveraging camera\u2019s functionality in AR features, remote control, and many more.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Best Tools For Enterprise Application Software Development<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17610\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Best-tools-for-enterprise-application-software-development.jpg\" alt=\"Best tools for enterprise application software development\" width=\"696\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Best-tools-for-enterprise-application-software-development.jpg 696w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Best-tools-for-enterprise-application-software-development-300x216.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Best-tools-for-enterprise-application-software-development-600x431.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Best-tools-for-enterprise-application-software-development-450x323.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, enterprise apps are created for huge workforces and different company roles.
