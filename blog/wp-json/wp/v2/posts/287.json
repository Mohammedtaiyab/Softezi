It\u00a0takes discipline and commitment combined with focused direction. But where do\u00a0you start? Maybe you\u2019ve got the drive, but not the direction\u2014or maybe you\u2019ve got a\u00a0direction without a\u00a0particular destination? We\u2019ve gathered some tried-and-true advice to\u00a0give you a\u00a0step up\u00a0in\u00a0entrepreneurship:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Find the pain.<\/strong> Identify a\u00a0bottleneck somewhere\u2014an abrasive point in\u00a0a\u00a0given system that is\u00a0just rubbing a\u00a0particular group of\u00a0people the wrong way. When you can identify one, then you can form a\u00a0potential idea.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) Never lose focus of\u00a0the solutions.<\/strong> Being an\u00a0entrepreneur means being a\u00a0problem solver. (Note: the problem you\u2019re solving is\u00a0never \u201cMoney\u201d). Think of\u00a0your ability to\u00a0solve problems as\u00a0a\u00a0fitness level: something you need to\u00a0constantly hone and keep in\u00a0shape. Every problem must be\u00a0met as\u00a0an\u00a0obstacle that needs overcoming\u2014whether you\u2019re dealing with customers or\u00a0you\u2019re dealing with the internals of\u00a0your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/startups\">start-up business<\/a>. Adapt, solve, and move\u00a0on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) Don\u2019t hold back:<\/strong> especially when it\u2019s time to\u00a0critique yourself. Brutal honesty, whether it\u2019s about your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/the-importance-of-mobile-app-marketing\">marketing strategy<\/a> or\u00a0your deliverables, is\u00a0invaluable if\u00a0you wish to\u00a0leap and bound through improvements. This goes double if\u00a0you\u2019re in\u00a0the service industry: you MUST be\u00a0easy to\u00a0work with. And you MUST be\u00a0willing to\u00a0change in\u00a0those areas that you need\u00a0to. Be\u00a0the type of\u00a0entrepreneur that will go\u00a0slightly beyond scope to\u00a0get things taken care of\u00a0for the customer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4) Convenience and simplicity<\/strong> are the nuts and bolts of\u00a0any kind of\u00a0start-up. Whether you\u2019re offering a\u00a0service or\u00a0a\u00a0product: from food to\u00a0tech, this is\u00a0what will make people want to\u00a0pay. Great solutions are often overlooked by\u00a0big clients because they\u2019re more expensive to\u00a0implement than to\u00a0simply let the problem continue.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5) Big things have small beginnings<\/strong>, so\u00a0don\u2019t be\u00a0afraid to\u00a0start small. It\u00a0may be\u00a0only a $200.00 starter contract, but the I-can-trust-you-to-do-this-well currency is\u00a0far more valuable than USD in\u00a0the long-run. Small contracts often turn into substantially larger, ongoing business relationships.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6) Always make yourself the business owner.<\/strong> You\u2019ll run into times where you\u2019ve collected you\u2019re payment and are now just muddling through to\u00a0half-heartedly get the work done. Visualizing that you\u2019ve actually bought the company will motivate you to\u00a0do\u00a0the work much differently\u2014and that kind of\u00a0enthusiasm will definitely be\u00a0reflected in\u00a0the end results.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7) Pick &amp; choose your clients.<\/strong> Customers that are one-man-teams with similarly low budgets, for example, can make every dollar you receive feel like a\u00a0hundred, placing unneeded pressure on\u00a0your own business model.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro-Tips:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1)<\/strong> Your education means squat to\u00a0potential clients (and investors). People just want to\u00a0know whether you can solve the problem or\u00a0not.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2)<\/strong> Don\u2019t worry about the future: today\u2019s troubles are enough for today.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3)<\/strong> Stay clear of\u00a0getting sucked into endless podcasts and \u201centrepreneur self-help.\u201d The content is\u00a0endless and wastes valuable time when you could be\u00a0getting things done.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4)<\/strong> In\u00a0any particular skill, teach yourself enough to\u00a0move forward. You\u2019ll learn by\u00a0taking bite-size chunks, not trying to\u00a0force the whole feast down your gullet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5)<\/strong> An\u00a0idea aloe is\u00a0completely worthless, it\u2019s only what you do\u00a0with it\u00a0that adds value to\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6)<\/strong> Your ideas are not (nor will they be) unique. First focus on\u00a0execution\u2014then when you actually have something to\u00a0protect, do\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p>Take these tips to\u00a0heart and carry them with you as\u00a0you strive towards success, whether it\u2019s in\u00a0Silicon Valley, selling eBooks, or\u00a0opening an\u00a0ice-cream shop. If\u00a0you listen, this advice will take you far.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Start-up entrepreneurship is an enticing journey: you carve your own path towards success, become your own boss, and tell your rags-to-riches story.
