Maybe, that won\u2019t be your scenario, but you must have witnessed how contemporary success stories drive masses of entry-level entrepreneurs to at least try that startup idea and launch an app. It promises many inspiring things \u2013 like profit generation, positive change expectations, and effective empowerment of the existing business.<\/p>\n<p>However, many people abandon the plan to launch an app once they witness problems in an oversupply of mobile solutions and realize their inability to explain why they fail. At the same time, these reasons are rather objective: either the quality of unsuccessful apps is poor or the essential stages to launch mobile app were violated.<\/p>\n<p>To fix the first issue, you need a team of professionals. But to cure the lack of knowledge about the accurate process to launch an app, you can just read this post.<\/p>\n<p>This comprehensive instruction will help to launch mobile app FOR REAL. It contains 25 steps that can guide you from the raw startup idea to the post-launch maintenance activities of your app:<\/p>\n<p>1. Problem identification<br \/>\n2. Idea choosing<br \/>\n3. Validation<br \/>\n4. Industry research<br \/>\n5. User persona<br \/>\n6. Competitor analysis<br \/>\n7. Positioning<br \/>\n8. Distinguishing main strengths in an app<br \/>\n9. Picking pricing model<br \/>\n10. Branding<br \/>\n11. Landing page publication<br \/>\n12. Completing pre-launch<br \/>\n13. Mockup<br \/>\n14. UI\/UX design<br \/>\n15. Coding<br \/>\n16.

Reengaging activities<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s check how to make each this step right. Rely on the experience of digital geniuses to make your app idea work and impress the world!<\/p>\n<h2>STAGE 1. Accurate planning<\/h2>\n<h3>Step #1. Identify the problem your app will solve<\/h3>\n<p>Many developers not just forget to start from problem identification \u2013 they disregard this step completely. By doing this, they make one of the biggest mistakes ever: they face the failure of an overall initiative to launch an app.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we recommend each young entrepreneur to consider problem-solving approach seriously. Before you let your mind captured by your brilliant ideas or start working on the product itself, calm yourself down by asking, \u201cWhich customer pain I want to solve?\u201d. This simple mental exercise can awesomely direct your efforts from making another useless mobile app to something worthy and needed by people.<\/p>\n<p>Once you concentrate on launching a mobile solution (and not just an empty app), even the atmosphere in which you launch mobile app changes. It gifts an additional shot of inspiration, increased motivation, and a sense of purpose \u2013 both to yourself and your team.<\/p>\n<p>While identifying customer pain, stick to the basic principle of thinking big and acting small. That will help you accumulate all the necessary experience and suffer from minimum losses. And prepare you to make a really significant change.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #2. Find a good idea<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve defined the customer pain you will solve, it\u2019s time to brainstorm ideas. Collect and weigh as many thoughts as possible to make sure the one you\u2019ll choose is the best of the best.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the way how to make it carefully:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the very beginning, try to gather as many bad ideas as possible. Aim at reaching 100 points in your list of terrible solutions to that sharp problem you\u2019ve noticed on Step #1. Don\u2019t limit your imagination \u2013 usually, the great idea appears somewhere between 20th and 80th position. Just don\u2019t stop exploring and creating!<\/li>\n<li>To get some extra inspiration while stuck, investigate forums and thematic groups in social media. Don\u2019t be shy to start conversations with people and test your ideas (or ask strangers for theirs) while talking to those facing the identified pain.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you finally picked a couple of great ideas with which you can launch mobile app, scrutinize them by asking these questions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Which actions can lead your product to come into the market?<\/li>\n<li>What makes your solution special?<\/li>\n<li>Why should people download your app?<\/li>\n<li>Are you able to develop a sustainable business plan to make it work?<\/li>\n<li>Is it easy to steal and\/or copy your idea? How can you protect yourself from this harm?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If your idea can stand such interrogation under duress, you can move forward!<\/p>\n<h3>Step #3. Validate your idea<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-18083\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-200x300.jpeg\" alt=\"How to launch an app Validate your idea\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-200x300.jpeg 200w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-600x900.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-300x450.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-667x1000.jpeg 667w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea.jpeg 668w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To complete the planning stage, create a low-tech prototype you can touch and test. You don\u2019t have to make it detailed and tech-savvy! That\u2019s a technological representation of an app purpose you\u2019ve created in your head, nothing more. On this stage, you just need to check whether everything you\u2019ve identified in your idea checklist can be reflected in the form of a digital solution.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>STAGE 2. Conducting research<\/h2>\n<h3>Step #4. Investigate the industry<\/h3>\n<p>Before you dive into the development stage and actually launch mobile app, learning the market context is none the worse for. To conduct industry research, play with Google Keyword Planner and AppAnnie tools. SEO and PPC specialists frequently use them, and there\u2019s no surprise \u2013 these instruments provide you with useful insights into what people search in Google and which keywords are relevant for your specific market niche. Lucky you, that\u2019s the basic information to launch an app too.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #5. Create a user persona<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to understanding the market, it\u2019s essential to know your customers well. Spend a fair amount of time to learn their demographical traits, tastes, typical behaviors, and attitudes. All these data will make your users attracted by the product you\u2019ll create for them.<\/p>\n<p>After you\u2019ve collected all the relevant information, create the user persona. This method makes you think of an ideal client \u2013 the one who contains the most typical features and reveals the most common patterns you\u2019ve identified.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the process of how to work on user persona:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Include raw data: age, location, specification, relationship status, etc;<\/li>\n<li>Draft a typical bio to create the story of your user persona;<\/li>\n<li>Add sections with wishes, needs, and common fears to capture the emotional portrait;<\/li>\n<li>Include relevant skills and specifications;<\/li>\n<li>List favorite brands, food, and places (or any other details relevant for your research).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Step #6. Analyze competitors<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, you won\u2019t get the full picture of the context without checking the behavior and business tactics of your main rivals. The easiest way to search for your key competitors is to read Google articles dedicated to the top 10 companies in your niche. Your direct competitors are those several ones that appear the most frequently.<\/p>\n<p>While researching your competitors, ask them these questions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Who are their target users?<\/li>\n<li>Why are they so popular?<\/li>\n<li>Which exact keywords make their ranking that high?<\/li>\n<li>What do customer reviews say?<\/li>\n<li>What did they look over (and so, my app can improve)?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Collecting these answers will make you confident about the cheerful prospects of your future success!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-18084 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"How to launch an app - Analyze competitors\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-600x400.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-450x300.jpeg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors.jpeg 1050w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>STAGE 3. App launch marketing plan<\/h2>\n<h3>Step #7. Develop Positioning Statement<\/h3>\n<p>So, once you\u2019ve convinced yourself and your market that an idea created in your head should see the world, it\u2019s time to start marketing! The proper start is to create your positioning statement that addresses three main questions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who will use my app?<\/li>\n<li>What advantage does it bring to these people?<\/li>\n<li>Why is this app more valuable to my users than all the other apps available?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve elaborated your answers to these questions, all the marketing steps you\u2019d take in the future should empower that statement \u2013 again and again. That will contribute to your brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p>Remember: your task is to create something special, valuable, and different from all those millions of apps available in AppStore. Dedicate maximum attention to creating your Unique Value Proposition \u2013 that\u2019s the phrase that will hook your target audience and convince them to stay with you. And yes, never deceive your positioning statement ever after.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #8. Define your main strengths<\/h3>\n<p>The completion with other apps will be cruel, so you need to spend some time designing the list of all the counterarguments you will use to fight them all.<\/p>\n<p>For useful insights, refer to these two sources of information:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Competitor\u2019s reviews. Learn the key problems other apps reaching your target customers have experienced \u2013 and solve them in your solution.<\/li>\n<li>Marketing channels missed. If your competitors don\u2019t use YouTube, blogs, or Product Hunt \u2013 well, you know what does it mean for you, right?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Also, pay attention to the most common pricing models, the level of customer satisfaction, and the frequency and quality of version updates. On all these weaknesses, you can build your power.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #9. Choose the best pricing model<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on the aims of your app and the expectations your target customers carry, you can use different approaches to asking for money in your app. The most common model is \u201cfreemium,\u201d which means that users are granted free access to the limited version of a product, but its full functionality is available upon subscription. Alternatively, you can go for free, subscription-based, or in-app purchases models.<\/p>\n<p>To make the final decision, consider the size of your audience: if it\u2019s a niche market, you can risk and launch an app that is downloaded for money. If your task is to reach maximum people, that\u2019s possible with a free solution only.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #10. Develop branded screenshots and visuals for marketing<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-18085\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"How to launch an app - Develop branded screenshots and visuals for marketing\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-600x400.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-450x300.jpeg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing.jpeg 1050w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Complete pre-marketing activities by developing the brand book of your app. It doesn\u2019t mean designing a comprehensive mobile marketing campaign \u2013 but you need to notify about the app release date and construct the overall brand awareness from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>Never miss the chance to tell the story of your app. Design various beautiful visuals with the emotional appeal in different formats \u2013 you can use them as materials for press, social media banners, creative elements in the e-mail marketing campaigns, etc. Also, pay attention to the promo video. With it, you can both introduce your product and reengage customers over and over again (in social media posts, on a landing page, and in the description on AppStore).<\/p>\n<p>Complete the package you\u2019ll send to influencers and press. In its visual part, it should include a logo, an icon, screenshots, and the promo.<\/p>\n<h2>STAGE 4. Pre-Launch Activities<\/h2>\n<h3>Step #11. Publish a landing page for your app<\/h3>\n<p>Even though your efforts are mostly connected with the need to launch a mobile app, don\u2019t underestimate the potential of a website in empowering your success. Generally, a landing page can help you in several ways:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It facilitates checking whether your idea is really profitable and viable,<\/li>\n<li>It enables collecting e-mails of your first clients and communicating with them,<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s useful for lead generation,<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s effective in showcasing all the product advantages, customer reviews, and press references.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To create a landing page, register your domain, fill all the relevant information, and add a submission form for your visitors to leave their e-mails. To make it quick, use the services like Instapage, Wix, LaunchRock, and Unbounce. Also, don\u2019t forget to link your landing page with services for data collection and analytics \u2013 you won\u2019t regret having direct access to Google Analytics and Optimizely.<\/p>\n<p>Use your landing page to pitch your app idea, share private beta versions to test your product on its development stage, communicate its positioning and strengths, and promote it on a post-launch stage!<\/p>\n<h3>Step #12. Complete all the preparations to app launch campaign<\/h3>\n<p>At this stage, you complete all the warming up before diving into the hard development. Use all the information you\u2019ve gathered to complete the pre-launch checklist!<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Complete the product description page. Use all the information you\u2019ve gathered on the previous steps to create a catching text that describes your app to clients. It should work for the perfect advertising of your app.<\/li>\n<li>Determine the main influencers in your industry and establish communication with them. Don\u2019t underestimate the role of networking and communication \u2013 especially if you just entered the market with the new product.<\/li>\n<li>Craft app promotion campaign. Create the list of advertising activities you\u2019ll launch in various marketing channels \u2013 social media, communication with bloggers, traditional advertising platforms, and the way your website will work.<\/li>\n<li>Prepare a press kit. Create a directory that contains the most powerful information about your app (both visual and textual), the list of all the platforms where you\u2019re present (website, forums, social media), and your contact information. Send it to press representatives.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-18086\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Complete-all-the-preparations-to-app-launch-campaign-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"How to launch an app - Complete all the preparations to app launch campaign\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Complete-all-the-preparations-to-app-launch-campaign-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Complete-all-the-preparations-to-app-launch-campaign-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Complete-all-the-preparations-to-app-launch-campaign-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Complete-all-the-preparations-to-app-launch-campaign-600x400.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Complete-all-the-preparations-to-app-launch-campaign-450x300.jpeg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Complete-all-the-preparations-to-app-launch-campaign-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Complete-all-the-preparations-to-app-launch-campaign.jpeg 1051w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>STAGE 5. Development<\/h2>\n<h3>Step #13. Create the mockup<\/h3>\n<p>So, everything is ready to start developing your product! For one thing, create a basic sketch of your product. Omit using mixed colors and including sophisticated heavy details \u2013 all you need to do is to outline the main blocks and their connections. Aim at creating a general perspective with the basic interactions and overall app flow on this step.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the process of creating a mockup:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Write down basic app functionality and user interface features your digital solution must have<\/li>\n<li>Create a series of screens for each element<\/li>\n<li>Draft requirements for UI \u2013 include general elements first, then add some essential details<\/li>\n<li>Add supporting notes with explanations where needed<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The mockup is like a pencil sketch, not a complete picture. Prefer blue-sky thinking about general concepts to down-to-earth back-breaking detail-drawing. You\u2019re just preparing yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #14. Apply graphic design<\/h3>\n<p>That\u2019s where your maximum attention to the details is the main requirement. Your final task is to show how the app will look \u2013 from point to point, in a complete color palette, and containing all the layouts and UI elements. That\u2019s the step where each centimeter and each pixel matter.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s a high time to invite UX\/UI professional. Only this specialist can complete this task as well as your app needs. Don\u2019t skimp and save here \u2013 the major part of your success depends on the beauty and usability of UI\/UX design specifically.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #15. Code<\/h3>\n<p>This is another hard-working step that is a prerequisite to the appearance of your app. Similar to the case of the design, the importance of coding calls for the best programming specialist you can find.<\/p>\n<p>Think of the number of platforms you\u2019re aiming at. You can launch an app for iOS or Android (good native coding platforms Xcode and Swift). Alternatively, you can invest in cross-platform solutions \u2013 here, pay attention to React Native, Flutter, and Xamarin as useful tools. Finally, check out Parse.com and Firebase \u2013 they are great backend-as-a-service instruments to work with data assets.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to check the guidelines of the platforms you\u2019ve chosen \u2013 to ensure the submission process will go smoothly and bug-free.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #16. Beta-test<\/h3>\n<p>The more features and platforms your app needs, the greater the importance of beta-testing. Precisely, it\u2019s necessary to fix as many problems as possible before you launch your mobile app \u2013 otherwise, the whole product can alienate your target customers once and for long. So, always check your progress through both internal and external testing of your app. Reach your fans, friends, and even friends of your friends to collect all the data and testimonials needed to ensure you\u2019ll celebrate your launch, not save your solution from losses and bugs. Try TestFlight, a solution that allows beta testing of your app both internally and externally.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, all this doesn\u2019t mean that beta-testing will save your product from ALL the glitches you\u2019ll notice after the release. You just need to make sure you\u2019ve done everything possible to prevent those bugs and mistakes that appear in the early development stages.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #17. Prepare technical tools to leverage audience and collect data on your app<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-18087 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-200x300.jpeg\" alt=\"How to launch an app - Prepare technical tools to leverage audience and collect data on your app\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-200x300.jpeg 200w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-600x900.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-300x450.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-667x1000.jpeg 667w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app.jpeg 668w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We highly recommend developing in-app messaging in advance. This will help you collect precious feedback \u2013 both on the beta-testing step and long after the launch.<\/p>\n<p>Also, connect services that will help you work with analytics right before launching. For this purpose, the best picks are Crashlink (to work with crashes), Google Analytics (to measure engagement), and Fastlane (for better automation).<\/p>\n<p>Aaaand\u2026 are you ready for the next long-expected step?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>STAGE 6.

It\u2019s time to celebrate launching an app!<\/p>\n<p>The vital task here is to let everybody you can reach know the news and open the champagne to celebrate this happening with your team!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>STAGE 7. Post-launch activities<\/h2>\n<h3>Step #19. Keep track of your rating<\/h3>\n<p>In the first couple of weeks, don\u2019t lose your sense of reality and constantly check your performance. For this, rely on prepared KPIs and work with the metrics on a daily basis.<\/p>\n<p>In the beginning, get ready to face high volatility in your rankings. Simply get track of rating, reviews, the number of downloads, and retention rate. This objective information will help you see the bigger picture and provide a sustainable background for the first updates.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #20. Immediately adjust your keywords (if needed)<\/h3>\n<p>Among the prior changes on the post-launch stage, prepare to revise the keywords. Having a tremendous impact on your ranking in both AppStore and Google Play, keywords, if changed on time, can improve your position dramatically.<\/p>\n<p>Among the fields to revise, pay attention to the app\u2019s title, the list of meta keywords, and meta description. The make all the difference.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #21. Get early testimonials<\/h3>\n<p>For the post-launch stage, it\u2019s all about reviews. You should provoke, collect, and process them. At the same time, we recommend not only checking the reviews left by your customers but also adjust your description with the best examples. Doing this can increase trust to you and boost popularity \u2013 especially if you get somebody like Leonardo di Caprio among your reviewers!<\/p>\n<p>Just don\u2019t be shy and ask influencers and celebrities for the review by yourself! Both critics and fans contribute to your success. Besides, they attract new users who judge your product by reading reviews and scanning descriptions \u2013 so update the review list and description info as often as it\u2019s needed to make it perfect!<\/p>\n<h3>Step #22. Develop social media accounts and reach existing online communities<\/h3>\n<p>Among the most important areas to develop on the post-launch stage, pay attention to users who gather in social media, blogs, and forums. Link your social accounts to your landing page so that your audience can reach you on both platforms. Invest in social media and content marketing \u2013 but do it wisely. Be active in thematic Facebook groups and on Instagram. Talk to your customers and search for immediate insights into your market. And also, keep an eye on influencers in your industry and develop strategical partnerships.<\/p>\n<p>There are so many ways to use social media for your app. Don\u2019t neglect their potential!<\/p>\n<h3>Step #23. Work on media outreach strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Along with working on social media, it\u2019s crucial to establish beneficial communication with the press. In this context, rely on the value of your product and your unique selling points. By building relations with journalists and bloggers, communicate your story to build sincere connections. To find your audience, use Google News, Reverse Google Image Search, and Help-A-Reporter-Out (HARO).<\/p>\n<p>And never forget to show them your awesome brand book!<\/p>\n<h3>Step #24 Promote your app<\/h3>\n<p>Marketing strategy constantly supplements your app launch \u2013 but it gets the solemnity on the post-launch stage. You can do many things here \u2013 and reviewing them deserves a separate post.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we list you just some ideas for you to investigate and get more target customers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Participate in the curated lists,<\/li>\n<li>Apply paid advertising,<\/li>\n<li>Try App Store Optimization (ASO),<\/li>\n<li>Use push notification,<\/li>\n<li>Use A\/B testing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Step #25 Reengage your users<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-18089\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"How to launch an app - Reengage your users\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-600x400.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-450x300.jpeg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users.jpeg 1051w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Finally, you should never forget about the people who already chose to stay with your app. Entertain them with new content and fresh updates. Keep an eye on their behavior. Remain the perfect app for their needs.<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, carefully listen and instantly react to the feedback you receive from your fans. From the very beginning, you initiated an app to solve their problem \u2013 so, at the end of the app launch journey, you should always stick to this purpose to not only keep your ratings high but also ensure you create value.<\/p>\n<h2>Final note: How much does it cost to launch an app?<\/h2>\n<p>If we reached our aim of writing this post, the task of launching an app should not seem hard for you anymore. The only thing to cover is the revealing the amount of resources you\u2019ll need to start.<\/p>\n<p>This answer depends on many factors: the app type you want to develop, the exact number of platforms, design sophistication, databases used, the appearance of adds-on, etc. With the different combinations of these factors, the sum can range from $10,000 to $500,000.<\/p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s always better to contact the development team and get the real price from them. Compare different teams to make the final choice.<\/p>\n<p>We wish good luck with your app launch \u2013 and let you open many bottles of champagne for success!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As one of my favorite jokes says, each millennial should ruin a startup, record a podcast, and burn out.
