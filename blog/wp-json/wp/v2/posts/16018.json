In other words, SDLC is a blueprint designed for a team to create, maintain, and fix digital products. The steps of a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> process depend on the project size and project goals. Each step also provides a general map on how it should be completed. In most cases, every development team creates its own <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or adopts one of the models, which we will explore further. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How Does a Software Development Life Cycle Work?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SDLC cycles<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provide an overview of tasks for a project, they are not a ready-to-use manual. A SDLC is not set in stone: there are different models and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">examples of software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The latter depend on project complexity, and so do the many <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle methodologies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Nevertheless, the core idea of a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> remains \u2013 it is an order of tasks aimed at creating a digital solution. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Benefits of Software Development Life Cycle \u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key reason behind adopting a clear SDLC is control over the development process. A working plan, conflict management between participants, and budget management are other big <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advantages of software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows for:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having overarching control over software development process<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving resource management and cost-effectiveness<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gives teams a clear action plan<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improves cooperation between participants<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is important to remember is that all the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advantages of software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will not work for teams on their own. If project managers lack expertise or some participants refuse to follow the process, the cycle will fall apart, influencing the quality of the final product.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Software Development Life Cycle Models <\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a host of different SDLC models that help in different types of software development projects, even in cases when the client does not have a clear vision of what they need.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Waterfall Model<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SDLC Waterfall model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, all the steps should be finalised before the development can start. One of the basic preconditions of the<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Waterfall model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to receive approval on each stage before the team can move on to the next one. This approach can be effective in risk mitigation in the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here, the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waterfall model <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uses a Business Requirements Specification (BRS) that helps teams evaluate each step. While some software development companies still offer this model of cooperation, this type of a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is less popular than other, more flexible models on our list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-16019\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-Example-Waterfall-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Software Development Lifecycle Examples\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-Example-Waterfall-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-Example-Waterfall-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-Example-Waterfall-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-Example-Waterfall-600x337.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-Example-Waterfall-450x253.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-Example-Waterfall-1000x562.png 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-Example-Waterfall.png 1432w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>V-Shaped Model<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V-Shaped Model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is similar to Waterfall, and can be considered as its extension. Therefore, the methodological basis of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V-Shaped model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to guarantee the completion of tasks on one stage before moving on to the next one. This model also divides the development process into different challenges. Another feature of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V-Shaped model SDLC<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is constant trialing, which makes it stand out among some other development lifecycle models.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Iterative Model<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Iterative model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has many <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development cycles <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that are segmented into smaller cycles. In addition, this model ensures a solid start for a software product with the help of trialling. Among the concrete <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle model examples<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> here, Rational Unified Process allows for avoiding the confinements of some other <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle models.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As the dynamic systems elaboration method used in this model divides the cycle into several smaller ones, allowing for micromanagement, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Iterative model SDLC<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is among the most reliable approaches to the development process. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Spiral Model<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spiral model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a universal <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Similar to the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Iterative model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it emphasizes the value of smaller cycles within larger <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SDLC cycles<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. How? the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spiral Model SDLC<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> closely puts together all the key steps of the development process. This <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> eliminates the complexities of any traditional <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software engineering lifecycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This level of efficiency comes at a cost: developers will spend more time on tasks. Still, the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spiral model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the most useful approaches to gradual improvements of a product among <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle models<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Big Bang Model<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Bang model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has no guidelines at all. This <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was conceived to help navigate projects where client does not know what the final software product will look like. More specifically, the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Bang model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is built for projects were the initial information is so vague that the model itself does not involve a specific process beyond its concepts or any planning: the team needs to figure the project out as they go. Where would one apply it? The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Bang model SDLC<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fits for small development efforts, small development teams, and might also be suitable for short-term experiments. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Agile Model<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The flexible development approaches of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agile Model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> help to ensure a streamlined software development process that allows for fast adjustments. The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agile SDLC model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> includes XP and Scrum approaches, which cover the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SDLC cycles<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with two-week development sprints. The team shows the results to the client after each sprint as the client also leaves comments on what was created in two weeks time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most popular <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">models for software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Agile is aimed at more frequent releases and visible results. In Agile, the software product emerges gradually, and the client gives feedback every step of the way. The models also helps collect feedback and measure different aspects of the development process. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Software Development Life Cycle Stages<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16020\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-stages.jpg\" alt=\"SDLC cycles\" width=\"627\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-stages.jpg 627w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-stages-150x150-1.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-stages-300x300-1.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-stages-600x600-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/SDLC-stages-450x450-1.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>Stage 1 \u2014 Planning &amp; Requirements Analysis<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the start of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle stages<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the need to attract the most talented and experienced engineers inevitably arises. By considering the demands of the client, a skillful crew can create a reliable foundation for the rest of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle phases<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This stage has a number important steps. First, the team working on the project conducts a preliminary analysis to discover the aims and issues of their client. Based on the results, they propose a set of possible solutions, with a budget for each.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Stage 2 \u2014 Defining Requirements <\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sequence of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle stages<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> continues with a deep dive into the requirements, after the client has chosen a software solution. The team analyses documents related to the project, evaluates the client\u2019s existing ecosystem. This is one the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle steps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that some consider transitional, performing it alongside planning and requirements analysis. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Stage 3 \u2014 Designing Product Architecture<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having fully analysed the client\u2019s requirements on previous <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle stages<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the developers create several product architectures and show them to the client.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chosen architecture is then finalised in a Design Document Specification (DDS) and evaluated by all sides in terms of risks, operational reliability, universality, and cost-effectiveness. This architecture becomes the foundation for all next <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stages of software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the software product in question. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Stage 4 \u2014 Developing the Product<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most critical <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle phases<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this one aims at producing working code and showing results to the client. The development takes the majority of time in any project. Often, the project exceeds the initially estimated time: the client might consider adding something to the project scope in the course of the development process. In some SDLC models, the product can change in the process of the development.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Stage 5 \u2014 Testing the Product<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all the preparations on previous <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stages of software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are completed, quality assurance engineers start scouting for bugs. Testing is another crucial step among the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SDLC life cycle phases<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as it allows for fixing critical problems before they will lead to critical loses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though testing procedures may appear on other <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle stages<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as a separate one, testing provides a detailed map of breakdowns that need to be fixed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Stage 6 \u2014 Deployment &amp; Maintenance<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the product is release-ready, the next action in the order of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle steps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to display the finished software solution to the client. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To guarantee the proper work of the finished digital solution in the future, after all the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SDLC life cycle phases <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are completed, the client can order general product maintenance to fix different issues (which inevitably emerge with any modern software product). This step completes the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Software Development Life Cycle Diagram<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is a general <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> diagram:<\/span><b> \u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16021\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Software-Development-Life-Cycle-Diagram-.gif\" alt=\"Software Development Life Cycle Diagram\" width=\"554\" height=\"431\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><b>Software Development Life Cycle Examples<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the explanations of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle with examples<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the most useful ones are those that explore the aforementioned models and stages in detail. Let\u2019s take a look at two interesting models that are not widely used. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Waterfall Model<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In practice, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waterfall Model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> SDLC starts after receiving the list of terms and conditions from the client, which is commonly reflected in a Customer Requirement Specification (CRS). Based on it, the analytical, financial, and technological departments summarize the project in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS). Then designers prepare several high and low-level design diagrams for developers. After the development stage is over, testing experts examine the solution\u2019s consistency with the project\u2019s Software Requirement Specification. If there are no issues (or after the existing issues are dealt with), the product is presented to the client. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among all the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle examples<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waterfall model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the most client-facing option, giving them extensive control over the project. On the other hand, the model lacks in flexibility, which can affect both the client and the team they hired. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Big Bang Model and the Definition of Requirements<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the first stage of all the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle examples<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it is crucial to get what the client needs from the developers. Often, the initial information is scarce and vague, and it is incredibly difficult to find a starting point. The situation can be so hopeless that an approach with no rules emerged \u2014 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Bang model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to approach such projects?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the techniques that help the customers clarify what they actually need, brainstorming, employee and management interviews, focus groups, surveys, and mind mapping are the most effective ones for the team working on such a project. Accuracy is key. For example, a survey needs to consist of clear, well-defined questions that need short answers. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Software Development Life Cycle Best Practices: Secure SDLC \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development life cycle examples,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> let\u2019s look at arguably the most important practice in our area of interest today. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Secure SDLC<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance to address the modern cybersecurity concerns called for creating a secure SDLC.
