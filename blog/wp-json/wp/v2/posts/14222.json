He retired from corporate product management in 2007 to start making things \u2015\u00a0and hasn&#8217;t looked back\u2026creating new things.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>At SF Mobile Entrepreneurs meetup\u00a0Dave shared some of the highlight from his entrepreneurial path and the story behind Sumry app.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/stanfy.com\/blog\/sfme-meetup-entreprenural-path-of-dave-hunkins\/attachment\/dave\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3626\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3626\" title=\"Dave Hunkins_SF Mobile Entrepreneurs meetup\" src=\"https:\/\/stanfy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/Dave.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>However, before we get to Sumry, let&#8217;s what other interesting projects Dave has worked on. First of all, really cool bags that can both serve as a grocery bag and as a backpack (when you are riding a bike, for instance). Then there were <a href=\"http:\/\/punch.zatchu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zatchu Punch<\/a>\u00a0\u2015\u00a0cardboard toys that help you develop spatial and critical thinking. What&#8217;s more, they are made of recycled materials! Then there were some experiments with <a href=\"http:\/\/stencil.zatchu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stencilizer<\/a>.\u00a0Remember, a tip from our previous <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/dos-for-mobile-app-development-from-shaan-puri\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">speaker Shaan<\/a>\u00a0about getting personal with your customers? That&#8217;s exactly what Dave does \u2015\u00a0sometimes he even personally delivers the products to his first customers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Juggling multiple startups that range from physical goods, fashion accessories to various web services, Dave usually works on 3+projects simultaneously. It helps him to focus on what&#8217;s really important.\u00a0Having played with some physical goods production, Dave also has interesting experiences in mobile. Dave has gone through all stages of creating a mobile app himself, and even learned to code! Having worked with a distributed team, remote co-founder, they still managed to finish app development with 2k. Can you believe it?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now let&#8217;s check out the app. <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.zatchu.distill&amp;hl=en\">Sumry<\/a>\u00a0is more than just a photo app. It allows you to capture images together with sounds. Then you can create a summary \u2015\u00a0which is as rich as a video, but as small as an image. It&#8217;s much easier to edit and share than a video, but it really captures a mood of the event much better than just a photo.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sumry is still at its early stage. Currently, Dave is figuring out some of the tech issues as well as the marketing strategy. So, I am sure soon we are going to hear about this product a lot!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Join\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/19DHh2r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SF Mobile Entrepreneurs Community<\/a>\u00a0to hear about the latest updates and our next meetup.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dave was infected with the Silicon Valley bug of startups and entrepreneurship almost 10 years ago.
