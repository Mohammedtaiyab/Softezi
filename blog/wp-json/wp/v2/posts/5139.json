The event was also hosted by an iconic Silicon Valley event series By the Bay, as well as artificial intelligence and data engineering company Provectus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gathering over 400 C-level executives, industry experts, blockchain engineers, and industry leaders, Rethink Trust successfully achieved its mission: bringing the spotlight back to the blockchain\u2019s problem-solving potential in the enterprise across industries and facilitate the discussion about it. The conference focused solely on business use cases of blockchain, how to implement it, the technology\u2019s future in the enterprise, and a multitude of other topics. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading the way were the blockchain industry\u2019s top minds. The first keynote of the conference came from IBM\u2019s Christopher Ferris, who introduced Hyperledger frameworks of 10 projects on which he has been working on. Mariana G\u00f3mez de la Villa from ING followed with a keynote arguing that Distributed Ledger Technology solutions will supersede blockchain in the financial industry, as the technology was not tailored to solve its problems. Mariana also displayed ING\u2019s project LEIA, a sovereign identity on a shared KYC utility (while her contribution to the industry amounts to 44 proofs of concept and 6 pilots projects. Later in the day, Oracle\u2019s Joost Volker explained how to make enterprise blockchain a reality and how existing enterprises use permissioned blockchain technology integrated with identity management and role-based access control to raise enterprise trust. As of now, over twenty organizations used Oracle\u2019s blockchain solution in their pilot programs. The conference had many other talks. The speakers focused on key issues in blockchain industry, from a detailed look on blockchain forks and scaling the technology to decentralized apps and blockchain in the energy sector. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rethink Trust also had 3 workshops, taking place in Beurs van Berlage\u2019s historic Berlage Zaal. Arnaud Le Hors, Senior Technical Staff Member of Web &amp; Blockchain Open Technologies at IBM, led a workshop about Hyperledger Fabric, while Topl\u2019s co-founder and lead engineer Nick Edmonds discussed the company\u2019s Edda framework with the audience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third workshop was the only event on Rethink Trust to have no available seats left: Nick Kurat, Director of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blockchain.intellectsoft.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intellectsoft Blockchain Lab<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and Tim Kozak, the Lab\u2019s Head of Technology, held a discussion on best practices, processes, and platforms in blockchain POC Development for the enterprise. Nick also gave a talk on real-life blockchain cases earlier in the day at the event&#8217;s main stage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWith all the hype around blockchain and mass anticipation of a bright future it has to bring, there are business and engineering professionals who make blockchain magic happen. We wanted to bring them under one roof to meet, share experience and facilitate the conversation about latest developments in DLT, as well as current technology challenges and ways to improve the existing developments,\u201d said Nick Kurat. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to all the attendees, speakers, partners, and sponsors who joined us to make Rethink Trust a reality. The conference was a great success and I\u2019m looking forward to Rethink Trust 2019 next year!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conference was part of <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/scale.bythebay.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the Bay<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the leading developer meetups and OSS conferences in Silicon Valley that partner with global technology giants like IBM, Apple, Twitter, Uber, and Salesforce. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur first Rethink Trust was a huge success \u2014 enterprise leaders from around the world had gathered at historic Stock Exchange of Amsterdam to charge lead Blockchain Data revolution. \u00a0We\u2019ve met a fantastic audience comprised of technical and business leaders of the largest global companies, including IBM, ING, ABN Amro, Bosch, KLM, and so many more, coming from around the world. Many Hyperledger practitioners stopped by as they were in town for their Hackfest. \u00a0The workshop track was full, and the discussions in the sponsor areas were lively. We are already looking forward to Rethink Trust 2019 US to be held in San Francisco in March 2019 \u2014 joins us!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the continuous advent of blockchain and DLT, the technology\u2019s gradual implementation in enterprises around the world, as well as including it in Industry 4.0 concepts, Intellectsoft is excited to bring the next, bigger chapter and further facilitate blockchain communication and implementation with the next Rethink Trust event. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out more about <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/blockchain.intellectsoft.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intellectsoft Blockchain Lab<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit the Lab\u2019s blog to read <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/blockchain.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/rethink-trust-2018-highlights-of-enterprise-engineering-blockchain-conference\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the story about the event<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Read about the keynotes from top minds of IBM, Oracle, and ING, the workshops, and other details.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":63,"featured_media":5141,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Focusing solely on blockchain technology business use cases, Rethink Trust 2018 was a huge success, gathering top minds from IBM, Oracle, ING.
