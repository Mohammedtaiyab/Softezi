Medicare and Medicaid patients made up almost 27% of UCC patients in 2018, confirming that the shift is not driven only by the young or affluent.<\/p>\n<p>The organization is flanking the physical services with digital efforts, with\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/cvshealth.com\/thought-leadership\/cvs-health-names-more-us-cities-for-healthhub-expansion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">almost 30% of the landing pages<\/a> on CVS.com Minute Clinic specific.

The COVID-19 crisis is forcing digital transformation in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/healthcare-it-solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IT solutions for healthcare<\/a> industry to take new turns.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #1476f2;\"><a style=\"color: #1476f2;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/healthcare\"><b>Intellectsoft Healthcare Solutions<\/b><\/a><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Since healthcare and economic environments force medical experts to take extra shifts, this greatly affects their own quality and safety of life.<\/p>\n<p>The idea behind Intellectsoft\u2019s solution was to empower medical professionals with a simple tool that gives them flexibility, control, and more.

Many traditional small markets have taken to online channels to hawk products, conduct online auctions, and even to carry out customer relation-building, for example, passing tips on how to prepare dishes using their products.<\/p>\n<p>However, most authorities are warning organizations <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankinfosecurity.com\/interviews\/coronavirus-spread-preparing-for-the-long-haul-i-4609\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to prepare for the long haul<\/a>.

Supermarket chains should consider integrating their online shopping platforms with the stock-holding information of their physical branches.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 may accelerate the growth of the online grocery sector. People did not just flock to physical supermarkets, but also loaded virtual carts with groceries from online platforms. With government directives to allow workers to work-from-home and to avoid non-essential trips to shopping malls, this trend of online shopping is likely to persist.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another possibility is for online shopping platforms to partner with businesses that specialize in delivery fulfillment such as UberEats, Grab, Glovo, and Bolt Food. B2B digital transformation trends are another milestone companies should consider today.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #1476f2;\"><a style=\"color: #1476f2;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/ecommerce-retail\"><b>Intellectsoft Solutions in E-commerce<\/b><\/a><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Since 2012, we\u2019ve specialized in custom E-commerce application development, building E-commerce platforms dedicated to client\u2019s needs or modify existing solutions to help scale-up businesses.
