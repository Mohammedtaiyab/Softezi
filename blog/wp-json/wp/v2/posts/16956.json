It is a challenging task regardless of the industry you operate in. As new technologies have emerged and consumer expectations changed, the concept of CX has been evolving into something new. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, it is hard to pinpoint what CX means today. Also, companies often do not have the resources to make CX improvements on their own, so the question of what customer experience services can bring to the table becomes important as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We prepared a comprehensive guide for you that answers these and more questions, providing real-life examples along the way.

Every CX is comprised of touchpoints \u2014 moments when a company interacts with a customer. A touchpoint is any type of interaction with a client, whether it is answering a question at a store, a call to confirm delivery details, cash desk service, or an outdoor ad.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As customers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/research\/customer-expectations\/#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demand more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from companies in every industry, the concept of customer experience has expanded beyond commerce. Companies like Google build their campuses approaching employees like retail stores approach customers, that is, aiming at high retention and satisfaction rates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16959\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cash-out-with-NFC-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"customer services experience\" width=\"842\" height=\"561\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cash-out-with-NFC-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cash-out-with-NFC-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cash-out-with-NFC-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cash-out-with-NFC-600x400.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cash-out-with-NFC-450x300.jpeg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cash-out-with-NFC-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cash-out-with-NFC.jpeg 1050w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where a retail chain would put up a sale, a tech company company offers its employees entertainment, recreation zones, and other bonuses. In this case, customer experience bears the name \u201cemployee experience.\u201d Governmental organizations adapt as well, digitalizing and simplifying governmental services for citizens. As a result, more and more subtypes of CX emerge in different industries, indicating that both commercial and other types of organizations give more attention to catering to their customers than ever before \u2014 terms like hotel\/guest experience, patient experience, event experience, are now the new normal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Customer Experience is More Important Than Ever<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not just naming for the sake of naming. According to a sweeping report on customer expectations by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/research\/customer-expectations\/#\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 67% of customers said their standards for good experiences are higher than ever, with 51% noting that most companies fail short of their expectations for great experiences.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16960\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Salesforce-Graphs.jpg\" alt=\"customer experience examples in services\" width=\"950\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Salesforce-Graphs.jpg 918w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Salesforce-Graphs-300x177-1.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Salesforce-Graphs-768x454-1.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Salesforce-Graphs-600x355-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Salesforce-Graphs-450x266-1.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every industry is inherently different, so customer experience is different, too. As a result, companies and organizations across industries look at how they interact with clients and improve the experiences based on the nature of the industry, client feedback, and customers\u2019 specific needs. In other words, every industry dedicates more resources to building industry-specific CXs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, hotels do not simply provide a generalised customer experience that rests upon a website, guest services, and a manager who will address guests\u2019 concerns \u2014 they think about the big picture, from booking to branded hotel app to new ways to amaze their clients in the face of competition from market disruptors. A generalised customer experience becomes a well thought out hotel experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a solid customer experience brings substantial benefits to any organization:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strengthens brand\/image of a company\/organization<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increases revenue<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attracts new customers<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boosts customer loyalty<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improves customer retention<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most companies do not build customer experiences on their own, more so if they involve the latest technologies \u2014 they enlist digital agencies or software and technology companies who offer customer experience services. As the field of customer experience design has been expanding over the years to address the ever-changing customer demand, more services emerged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s explore them below.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of Customer Experience Services<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer experience services can encompass everything from building a next-generation retail store to creating a mobile app that would converge all services in one place. So CX is as much about building an Amazon Go type of experience as it is about mobile app UX and UI design services.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">End-to-End CX Design (Full Customer Services Experience Development)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every company has a customer experience, but if you aim at meeting customer expectations at every touchpoint, you need end-to-end CX design. One of its main goals is creating a seamless connection between a company\u2019s physical and digital experiences. End-to-end CX design usually encompasses everything from creating intuitive websites and mobile apps to connecting all the company\u2019s systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Amazon<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a great example. Enabled by the decision to make an Amazon account the heart of the experience, everything in the company\u2019s CX is simple. Whether you want to buy a product, read a book on the device of your choice, shop at an Amazon Go store, watch a TV show on Amazon Prime \u2014 everything is interconnected, simplified, and only a few clicks away. A user only needs to register an Amazon account and provide basic details.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon uses virtually every technology available in its CX, from IoT to deep learning to robotics. Still, a comprehensive CX does not have to use everything to achieve solid results, even if it operates on a large scale. For example, a bank can transform its branches with web and mobile, a CRM system, embedded software development, and by redesigning the physical space itself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enterprise UX Services\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If CX in commerce deals with improving the process of buying goods\/services from a company for its clients, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/enterprise-software-development\">enterprise UX development services<\/a> focus on enhancing enterprise operations so that the company\u2019s employees would work more efficiently and comfortably. A good example comes from <\/span><b>Boeing<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, whose employees now use AR headsets in the wire assembly process instead of continuously consulting manuals. Results are staggering: assembly speed has risen by 25% while errors are down to nearly zero.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See the video below:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Upskill and Boeing Use Skylight to Reinvent Wire Harness Assembly\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qTblKJjTadQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer Mobile Experience Services<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of services involves creating a mobile-driven CX where a company\u2019s application is front and center, converging all its services in one place.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, Sweden\u2019s leading insurance provider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/cases\/euroaccident-mobile-app\">EuroAccident<\/a> transferred its insurance process to a simple mobile app. The company\u2019s clients can manage every step easily, from setting appointments to managing insurance for their children. Getting a refund is paperless \u2014 a user only needs to make a photo of the check, fill out a few fields, and press a button. The app is also integrated with the country\u2019s most popular booking service, the most widespread banking account authorization system, as well as the company\u2019s IT infrastructure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16962\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/EuroAccident-app-1024x747.jpg\" alt=\"customer mobile experience services\" width=\"842\" height=\"614\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/EuroAccident-app-1024x747.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/EuroAccident-app-300x219.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/EuroAccident-app-768x560.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/EuroAccident-app-600x438.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/EuroAccident-app-450x328.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/EuroAccident-app-1000x729.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>EuroAccident<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is service is often offered as part of mobile UI \/ UX design services, digital transformation services, or UX\/UI design and development services.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stand-alone Solution for Specific Touchpoint<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Say, a retail company has everything covered: mobile and web are interconnected, the company gathers user data to better cater to customers, employees at physical stores can anticipate what shoppers might need, and so on. Still, the company wants to strengthen their image and improve their sales further with something fresh.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emerging technologies provide a solution. A company can opt for creating an Augmented Reality (AR) kiosk for the store (we will explore an <\/span><b>Under Armour<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> example below) or install beacons that would be connected to a mobile app, delivering personalised offers at the right place and time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These services can also be referred to as customer experience IT services, as they involve both software development and sophisticated technology solutions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Build a tech-driven CX by leveraging 11+ years of industry-specific design expertise. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/contacts\">Get in touch with us<\/a>.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UI &amp; UX Design Services<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are typical UI &amp; UX design services you can find on the websites of most software development companies and digital agencies. They include web design, cross-platform design, mobile app design, and so on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the context of customer experience, common UI &amp; UX design services play a secondary role.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A company may need them when it already has a solid CX in place, but, for instance, needs to add a new mobile product to it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other UI and UX services might also be useful. Say, a big retail company has built a tablet app for their warehouses themselves, but it does not work properly. Turning to a software development company for UI and UX consulting will provide a solution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can UI &amp; UX design and development services involve the latest technologies?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, common UX and UI services can involve them. A company can create a website with a\u00a0 virtual reality (VR) feature in mind, or a mobile app with augmented reality. For example, a hotel can set up website-based VR tours of their locations, while an event company can create an AR app allows visitors view immersive AR installations on events\u2019 grounds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer Experience Examples In Services Of Leading Brands<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We briefly explored real-life examples of CXs across industries above, but more of them will give you a better idea of what CX is and what shapes it can take.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Full Customer Services Experience \u2014 Oasis<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.K. fashion retailer Oasis has merged its website, app, and store experiences into one seamless CX.

The stores\u2019 sales representatives are armed with iPads, enabling them to give customers accurate product information on the spot, as well as use the tablets as cash registers.

Still, an agency can have solid software developers, and a software development company the required marketing expertise, acquired in completing projects similar to yours.
