We&#8217;ve already taken a close look at <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfy.com\/blog\/hardware-platforms-for-internet-of-things-the-choices-we-make\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hardware platforms to choose from<\/a>, so now it&#8217;s the software&#8217;s turn.<\/p>\n<p>Any IoT solution revolves around a certain software solution that allows to retrieve, store, monitor and analyze data from all kinds of sensors. Volumes of data from sensors even in a reasonably sized IoT ecosystem is huge, which is why a cloud-based software platform is the best solution for your new product in most cases.<\/p>\n<p>You must have noticed that IoT is a hot topic in the world of technology. In 2014, this market reached $655 billion in size, while <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/cio\/2015\/06\/02\/internet-of-things-market-to-reach-1-7-trillion-by-2020-idc\/\">IDC predicts<\/a> this number to rise to $1.7 trillion in 2020. New products and solution appear every day, and most of them require a secure, versatile and flexible cloud platform to work on top of.<\/p>\n<p>That need is no secret to cloud platform providers and numerous startups, who now offer tailor-made solutions for IoT appliances. We&#8217;ve done some research in order to see how all these offerings stack up against each other.<\/p>\n<h3>Questions to ask<\/h3>\n<p>Before diving into the wide variety of different cloud IoT platforms, it&#8217;s vital to define the main aspects to learn about them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What hardware the platform supports<\/strong>. First of all, we need to know what hardware the platform supports; that&#8217;s particularly important if you already what your product is going to be based on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Instruments available for the platform<\/strong>. In addition to that, you should care about instruments available for the platform, including but not limited to an IDE for coding and API that you use to access your data.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Data management experience<\/strong>. There&#8217;s also the overall data management experience that consists of a dashboard, native and\/or web-based mobile and desktop applications and so on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The platform&#8217;s support for firmware updates<\/strong>. The other important things we&#8217;ve looked into are the platform&#8217;s support for firmware updates, its ease of use, supporting documentation and the existence of a healthy community around it. And, of course, the price, at which all this is available.<\/p>\n<h3>SensorCloud<\/h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sensorcloud.com\/\">SensorCloud<\/a> is a platform designed specifically for sensor data that promises to be able to store data with precision time information. It is created by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microstrain.com\/\">Lord Microstrain<\/a>, a US-based sensor manufacturer.<\/p>\n<p>Developers who want to work with the platform can access an elaborate SDK with code examples in Python, Java and C#.<\/p>\n<p>SensorCloud also offers a RESTful API, with which you can integrate all sorts of dashboards with the data stored there into your website or app in different ways<\/p>\n<p>Hardware-wise, SensorCloud obviously supports Lord Microstrain sensors, as well as products from any web capable platform using the API. There&#8217;s also support for CSV (text-based data) files. There&#8217;s unfortunately no way to send firmware updates via the platform, so you&#8217;ll have to do this differently, e.g. using Lord Microstrain PC software.<\/p>\n<p>The platform&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/LORD-MicroStrain\/SensorCloud\">GitHub repo<\/a> contains quite a bit of documentation to look through. The company claims the community around the platform consists of thousands of users though there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any dedicated place online to have a discussion with fellow users.<\/p>\n<p>Prices at SensorCloud are per gateway\/API device and range from free to $100 per month.<\/p>\n<h3>Particle.io<\/h3>\n<p>Our platform of choice that we love working with is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.particle.io\/\">Particle.io<\/a>, formerly known as Spark. Particle&#8217;s offering is a software and hardware suite that allows to quickly create prototypes and scale easily to full-fledged volume production.<\/p>\n<p>The hardware bits sold by Particle include a few development kits with Wi-Fi or cellular chips onboard, as well as various shields and accessories. Combining those with sensors and actuators, you can build an IoT system of any complexity in no time.<\/p>\n<p>Conveniently, Particle also allows you to update firmware of your microcontrollers over the air. There are security measures and a set of tools that make it easy to push updates and roll back to the previous version if there&#8217;s a problem.<\/p>\n<p>Developers are offered a few IDE options: Particle Build is a full-scale web IDE that runs in any browser, while for those who prefers offline solutions there&#8217;s Particle Dev, a traditional IDE build on GitHub&#8217;s Atom project.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s noteworthy that same code framework as Arduino \u2014 Wiring, \u2014 so in most cases Arduino code will run on a Particle board with no modifications. There&#8217;s also a cloud SDK for iOS (with Android version coming soon), command line interface, and a JavaScript library compatible with Node.js.<\/p>\n<p>Particle is an open-source platform with lots of code, firmware, templates and hardware design files <a href=\"http:\/\/spark.github.io\/\">readily available<\/a>. Same goes for an extensive volume of <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.particle.io\/guide\/getting-started\/intro\/photon\/\">documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s not in the manuals, Particle hosts quite vibrant <a href=\"https:\/\/community.particle.io\/\">community forums<\/a> and even an <a href=\"https:\/\/webchat.freenode.net\/?channels=%23particle\">IRC channel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Prices for the cloud solution range from free for individual developers to $99 per user per month for big teams with big needs.<\/p>\n<h3>Carriots<\/h3>\n<p>Another cloud platform, or rather Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), designed with Internet of Things in mind, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carriots.com\/\">Carriots<\/a> offers support for a huge number of devices and sensors, both for prototyping and industrial-scale. Among the first category are Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone and other similar solutions, while the second includes CloudGate, TST, Satel and so on.<\/p>\n<p>For developers, Carriots offers thoroughly documented REST API and an SDK based on Groovy scripting technology. Carriots doesn&#8217;t offer any ready-made dashboard but can be integrated with any visualization solution that can talk to its REST API.<\/p>\n<p>Carriots allows users to update firmware and remotely configure their devices. For questions not covered in the documentation and tutorials (which are pretty good), there&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/forum.carriots.com\/\">forum<\/a> that looks quite lively.<\/p>\n<p>The price of Carriots&#8217; cloud platform for corporate customers is \u20ac2 per month per device, with free accounts available with the number of devices limited to 10.<\/p>\n<h3>Firebase<\/h3>\n<p>Unlike the rest of the platforms we&#8217;ve talked about, Google-owned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.firebase.com\/\">Firebase<\/a> wasn&#8217;t built to cater for IoT developers&#8217; needs and is rather a universal cloud platform. It plays well with the Internet of Things, however: a good example here would be another Google-owned project and one of the IoT pioneers, Nest, which was build on Firebase.<\/p>\n<p>The platform can work with any hardware that can talk to its REST API, including but not limited to the ubiquitous Arduino kits. Being a universal cloud platform, Firebase doesn&#8217;t seem to provide an ability to update connected devices&#8217; firmware over the air and doesn&#8217;t include data visualization tools, which might be fine with those willing to assemble an IoT project from parts they choose themselves.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a comprehensive set of manuals for every occasion, and we&#8217;d also recommend reading these two posts to get a general idea of the way Firebase works with IoT appliances:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.firebase.com\/blog\/2014-09-22-realtime-iot-dev-with-firebase.html\">Realtime Internet of Things Development with Firebase<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/code-zen\/intro-to-iot-with-arduino-firebase-and-angular-js-ea08c70f41ef\">Interact With the Web in Real-time Using Arduino, Firebase and Angular.js<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Same as with most other platforms, pricing of Firebase ranges from free for small installations to $1,499 per month for lots of devices that generate tons of data.<\/p>\n<p>The cloud IoT platforms we&#8217;ve mentioned should be able to satisfy requirements of developers of any scale and industry.
