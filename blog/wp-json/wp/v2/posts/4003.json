Still, these Wi-Fi router-resembling devices are as technically grounded as they are game-changing: beacons are poised to transform companies across many industries, bringing a wide range of benefits to improve the way they operate and the user experiences they offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Beacons<\/b><b>\u00a0Improve User Experience<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the major advantages of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beacons<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that they improve the overall user experience at the front and back end of any business, streamlining operations and removing friction from day-to-day activities in a simple and smart way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><i>Beacons at the front end of business<\/i><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the front end, for example in a store, beacons become a part of an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indoor positioning <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/geolocation-navigation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outdoor positioning system<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (sometimes both), bringing contextual experiences to customers in the form of navigation tips and spot-on information (limited in-store offers, ads, notifications, etc.). \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><i>Beacons at the back end of business<\/i><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the back end of business, beacons are just as effective. Since back end environments are usually big, beacon devices are installed throughout the area, forming an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indoor positioning system<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The application at this end is similar: providing context, indoor and outdoor navigation, as well as allowing for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indoor tracking<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (a feature important for some companies). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warehouses and other storage locations are the best example. Enterprise <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enterprise applications<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will interact with beacons, and the employees\u2019 mobile devices will serve as a pass that allows them to easily navigate between warehouse storage areas. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, an employee needs a new laptop: they choose from a list of available devices and simply go to the warehouse, as beacons send signals to the app, providing access to the areas and navigation to the spot where the laptop is located. In a similar way, a construction worker will find the right equipment or material, and a delivery employee can check on items in a vast warehouse quicker and more conveniently. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Beacons<\/b><b>\u00a0Improve Marketing<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most modern technologies used in marketing today are complex, meaningful, and memorable \u2014 whether it is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/adressed.gapinc.com\/blog\/gap-ces-announcement-2017-dressingroom-app\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VR dressing room<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or an <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/creativity\/ibm-watsons-new-job-as-art-museum-guide-could-hint-at-lots-of-future-roles-with-brands\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-powered museum guide<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Marketing teams put this tech at the centre of the customer experience while other incorporated tech developments play secondary parts. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beacons<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are usually perceived as the latter, but they can be a leading technology, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.estimote.com\/post\/156727141740\/redbull-partners-with-byborre-cwi-and-nearables\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redbull<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> used beacon stickers to monitor the movement of the audience members during an event at a music venue. The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beacons<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gathered various data, and scientists created algorithms and deep neural nets to understand the guests\u2019 movements and energy levels. The data was then used to create a colorful map which the guests could view on the walls of a separate room. On top of that, the information gathered by beacons was used to make personal souvenir. This is also an example of how beacon technology can be used without any <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other, more common ways of how beacons improve marketing include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A different way to send ads: Beacons will send pre-set marketing messages to a mobile app whenever a customer is near a beacon or a beacon-based <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indoor positioning system<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A different path to monetization: Business can opt out of mobile and other ads by simply delivering information about deals with beacons, or delivering a beacon-based experience (like the example above) to improve sales.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One more way to gather data: Beacons gather customer data that will help tailor a better, even more personal shopping experiences and provide additional insights into customers\u2019 behaviour.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/app-management\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">content management<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IT technologies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software platforms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (in the case of beacons \u2014 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile application development frameworks<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) allow for convenient and fast content management similar to the well-built website CMS options. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New meaningful experiences for customers: There are different types of beacons, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/what-are-beacons-and-how-do-they-work\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video beacon<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the latest: it is plugged into a TV to deliver video content when a customer approaches the set with their smartphone. Such experiences are fresh and valuable; they save time while imbuing the usual customer journey with brisk, memorable moments.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Beacons are a Dependable, Cost-effective Investment<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An all-around look at beacons ultimately puts these devices into business priority lists. Beacons are cost-effective, easy to setup and manage, as well as incredibly adaptable: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standard models are small and made of low cost materials like plastic, so they are more economically effective than other state-of-the-art technologies.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most beacon devices are quick to deploy; some, like USB beacons, are as easy to install as a computer mouse. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beacons are dependable devices: unlike GPS, they use Bluetooth, so thick walls or underground areas won\u2019t block their signal. More so, some beacon suppliers offer beacons that are reinforced against exogenous factors: if a hotel wants a beacon in the swimming pool area or sauna, there are no roadblocks to installing it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most modern smartphones support beacon technology (iOS 7 or Android 4 or higher).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concurrently, as beacon technology only works with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile apps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, some beacons come with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile app development frameworks<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 tools that help a business single-handedly build an application to go along with the device; it comes with a software development kit (SDK) that also allows them to set up an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indoor-positioning system<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Still, if a company needs a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/enterprise-development\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">custom mobile application<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they can approach a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development company <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014 every competitive company in software development industry is dealing with beacon technology. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a company doesn\u2019t want to overspend, there\u2019s another option \u2014 using a third party application. For example, a retailer can use the mobile app of a mall where its store is situated to send beacon-based offers to the shoppers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the next posts, we will look at how companies in different industries use beacons.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business canno<\/span><\/em><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t afford to postpone a beacon solution any longer, do not hesitate and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/contacts\">get in touch with us<\/a>.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Streamlined operations, improved customer journey, and other advantages of beacons.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":63,"featured_media":4004,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2,13],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 -
