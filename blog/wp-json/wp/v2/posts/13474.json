If not, why?<\/p>\n<p>A landing page is a standalone page that visitors land on after clicking on an online marketing call-to-action. Each landing is designed for a specific marketing campaign. The purpose of a successful landing page is to grow your audience and convert visitors to customers, perhaps encouraging them to download the app, or purchase your product.<\/p>\n<h3>Almost Every Landing Page Consists Of These Elements:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP)<\/strong>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The main headline<\/li>\n<li>A supporting headline<\/li>\n<li>A reinforcement statement<\/li>\n<li>A closing argument<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>The hero shot (images\/video showing context of use)<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>The benefits of your offering<\/strong>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>A bullet point list summary of benefits<\/li>\n<li>Benefits and features in detail<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Proof<\/strong>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Social proof (I\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having)<\/li>\n<li>Trust indicators<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>A single conversion goal \u2013 your Call-To-Action (CTA) (with or without a form)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>While you may think landing pages are similar to homepages, but they serve different purposes. While a homepage constitutes the start of a visitor&#8217;s journey the landing page is designed to promote a specific product\/service and to give an overview of that particular service\/product with the aim of selling or capturing leads.<\/p>\n<h2>Ways of Using Landing Pages:<\/h2>\n<p><strong>To collect personal information (generate leads) in exchange for:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Report\/Whitepaper with important industry facts and statistics.<\/li>\n<li>Ebooks for comprehensive guides about different aspects of your business vertical.<\/li>\n<li>Newsletters with tips related to your area of expertise.<\/li>\n<li>Podcasts for people who like to listen and learn during a commute or workout.<\/li>\n<li>Checklists\/Scorecards for people that like to see how well they are doing and\/or benefit from a to-do list.<\/li>\n<li>Blog subscription to receive ongoing content via email or RSS.<\/li>\n<li>Webinar registration for live online sessions, often with Q&amp;As with experts and special guest presenters.<\/li>\n<li>Presentations or recorded sessions including video or slides.<\/li>\n<li>Consultation services<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-13494 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/lead-generation-landing-page-1.png\" alt=\"lead generation landing page\" width=\"850\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/lead-generation-landing-page-1.png 850w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/lead-generation-landing-page-1-300x133.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/lead-generation-landing-page-1-768x341.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/lead-generation-landing-page-1-600x266.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/lead-generation-landing-page-1-450x200.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWarming\u201d prospects up to your offering before you push them deeper into your sales funnel to:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Purchase your product or service online.<\/li>\n<li>Become a customer or subscriber of your online business.<\/li>\n<li>Employ any of the lead capture uses listed above, if you want to use an introductory page before sending them on to the landing page with your lead generation form.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-13482 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/warming-landing-pages.gif\" alt=\"warming landing pages\" width=\"703\" height=\"496\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Why App Landing Pages Are Different<\/h2>\n<p>Not all landing pages are the same. As demonstrated above, there are several different types of landing page. For mobile apps you\u2019ll need to focus visitor attention around the mobile app itself, giving a full overview of its core possibilities and why users should download your app (if this is your core action point).<\/p>\n<p>Decide on action steps that you want particular landing page visitors to make &#8211; like leaving his\/her contact details, or downloading your app &#8211; and design the landing page in accordance with these particular actions.<\/p>\n<h3>List of services for building mobile app landing pages:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.squarespace.com\/\">Squarespace<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; one of the most popular and best landing page builders, but needs to be customised for mobile app landing;<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/unbounce.com\/landing-page-templates\/mobile-app\/\">Unbound<\/a>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0templates offer plenty of opportunities to delight your mobile audience with video demos and product snapshots;<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/instapage.com\/landing-page-templates\">Instapage<\/a>\u00a0\u2013 has great app templates + lot of useful integrations;<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.leadpages.net\/\">Lead pages<\/a>\u00a0\u2013 has app landing pages templates + free tutorials\/webinars.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Why You Should Grow A User Base Before Launching Your App<\/h2>\n<p>You have built your app. You and your team love everything about it. What\u2019s next? <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfy.com\/blog\/tips-on-launching-a-mobile-app\/\">The reality<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Even if download rates show some interest in your app, the chances of people discovering it organically are close to zero. So to get your first thousand users you need to prepare for the launch and follow it through with an effective campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>Prepare For The Launch<\/h3>\n<p>The big launch of your full app website should coincide with the reveal of your app. Once your app goes live you should provide all the relevant details, including support and documentation, pricing, press kit, and a link to download in the app stores.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll continue to add more information to your site until it eventually includes reviews, user testimonies, more in-depth previews, and links to articles about your app. But be very specific in your messaging.<\/p>\n<h3>Message match<\/h3>\n<p>Most visitors are impatient and will leave your page within a few seconds of arrival if you don\u2019t reinforce their intent with a matching headline and purpose.<\/p>\n<p>This example shows a comparison of good and bad message match on a landing page used for a pay-per-click campaign:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13492\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Message-match.png\" alt=\"Message match\" width=\"740\" height=\"111\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Message-match.png 921w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Message-match-300x45.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Message-match-768x115.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Message-match-600x90.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Message-match-450x67.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Spread the word<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have your app landing page ready, it\u2019s time to attract some people to it. You\u2019ll need to entice the relevant visitors \u00a0&#8211; those who will be most likely to perform actions you want them to perform on your app landing page.<\/p>\n<p>Think about the diversification of traffic sources: referral, social, direct, search, email, and of course paid traffic.<\/p>\n<h2>4\u00a0Easy Tactics\u00a0to Get More From Your App Landing Page:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Waitlist \u2013\u00a0mailing list of people who want to be in touch with you when your app \u00a0launches;<\/li>\n<li>Surveys \u2013 a great way to collect feedback from your customers while developing a product;<\/li>\n<li>Social media channels \u2013 use them to create a place for people to gather and discuss your app, place \u00a0where you can talk with your customers;<\/li>\n<li>A\/B testing \u2013\u00a0act of running a simultaneous experiment between two or more pages to see which performs or converts the best.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Waitlist<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13478\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waitlist.png\" alt=\"Waitlist\" width=\"740\" height=\"493\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waitlist.png 2500w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waitlist-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waitlist-768x512.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waitlist-1024x683.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waitlist-600x400.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waitlist-450x300.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waitlist-1000x667.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Waitlist is mailing list of people who want to be in touch with you when your app \u00a0launches. With wait list you can keep people informed, sending the AppStore download link to those who were waiting for the initial app launch. In addition, you can gain feedback on initial app designs through surveys.<\/p>\n<p>Usually this feature is integrated in the most popular services for building landing pages.<\/p>\n<h3>Surveys<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13479\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Survey.png\" alt=\"Survey\" width=\"740\" height=\"493\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Survey.png 2500w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Survey-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Survey-768x512.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Survey-1024x683.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Survey-600x400.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Survey-450x300.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Survey-1000x667.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The next stage of your app landing page is about increasing interest by revealing more about your app and actively reaching out to potential users for app feedback. You can begin to introduce more details about your app&#8217;s features, a few screenshots, and additional materials as your app takes form.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.typeform.com\/\">Typeform<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/\">SurveyMonkey<\/a> should work perfectly for that.<\/p>\n<h3>Use Social Media Channels<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Social_media.png\" alt=\"Social_media\" width=\"740\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Social_media.png 2503w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Social_media-300x201.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Social_media-768x514.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Social_media-1024x686.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Social_media-600x402.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Social_media-450x301.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Social_media-1000x670.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At the same time, you should also start building up your social media channels. People will need a place to gather or get info about new features\/updates. Social media can be fun, but it\u2019s tricky when you\u2019re using it for business.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, try those social media channels where you think your target audience hangs out. Next measure the effect you get from each channel and try to create more engaging content, but only for those that are showing better efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>And don\u2019t forget to mention links to your company\u2019s social presence on your app landing page \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<p>You can even take it one step further by incorporating tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/sumome.com\">SumoMe<\/a>&#8216;s social sharing badge to enable users to share your app landing page with their own networks. When using this tool, try to think about why a particular user might want to share your page &#8211; this will help you to make your landing better.

Running these tests will enable you to create the best possible version of your app landing page.<\/p>\n<p><strong>List of the things you can test on your landing page:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Main headline<\/li>\n<li>The call to action (CTA) \u2013 typically the text that represents your page\u2019s conversion goal.<\/li>\n<li>Hero shot (showing your product\/app, could be a big photo\/mockup)<\/li>\n<li>Button design. Use design principles to accentuate the appearance of your CTA (contrast, whitespace, size).<\/li>\n<li>Button color \u2013 green for go, blue for link color, orange or red for emotional reaction.<\/li>\n<li>Form length. For lead capture and other form usage, you will want to minimize the amount of \ufb01elds that visitors are required to complete.<\/li>\n<li>Long copy vs. short copy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>And One More Thing..<\/h2>\n<p>Just a quick reminder, you\u2019ll inevitably be building an app landing page, so please make sure your mobile app landing is displaying smoothly on the majority of smartphones. I\u2019m sure that you&#8217;ll have at least 30% of people who will come to your page from their mobile devices and\/or tablets.<br \/>\n[custom_form form=&#8221;form-inline-subscribe&#8221; topic=&#8221;Product&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2>Summary<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter how big your idea is if the world doesn\u2019t know about it. So make sure your business is visible by creating a website\/landing page\/app. Crafting a great landing page is quick and simple with the help of landing builders like Unbounce or Squarespace, but spreading the word is much more important than building, so make sure your priority is to inform \u00a0people about your business.<\/p>\n<p>If this article was useful to you, make sure to share it
