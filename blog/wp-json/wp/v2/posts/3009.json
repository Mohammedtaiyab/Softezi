You\u2019re likely reading this from your gold-plated private jet. For the rest of us, even those who remember the clanging bells of a dial-up modem or the robotic voice reminding you that \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail,\u201d the Internet seems as natural as the air we breathe. It\u2019s incredible to think how heavily we have come to rely on a technology that didn\u2019t exist a generation ago.<\/p>\n<p><b>What is it?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Internet of Things (IoT) is the new\u00a0Internet. It is the next logical stage in the evolution\u00a0of data\u00a0networks. Although you may have missed the nascent stages, it\u2019s by no means too late to get on board. Right now is a pretty darned exciting time to be an app or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/about\" target=\"_blank\">software development company<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your perspective, the Internet of Things is somewhere on a spectrum\u00a0between Kubrickian horror and technological utopia. A lot of our \u201cthings,\u201d like our laptops, phones, tablets, televisions, and fitness trackers, are already a part of the IoT. The gist of the IoT is that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the electronic devices you use \u2013 alarm clock, lamp, toothbrush, coffeemaker, car (and that\u2019s just before you get to work) \u2013 will be connected to the internet in order to collect and transmit data. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world is changing. Today\u2019s kids can\u2019t imagine a world without the Internet. Tomorrow\u2019s kids won\u2019t be able to imagine a world without the Internet of Things. And it\u2019s time for a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/mobile-development\">mobile app development<\/a> company <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to understand the implications of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>It\u2019s the way of the future\u2026but it\u2019s still relatively unknown<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re still not sold on the Internet of Things, consider this: Intel, the tech giant which invented the modern day microprocessor,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">predicts that by the year 2020 there will be <a href=\"https:\/\/host.madison.com\/wsj\/business\/tom-still-the-internet-of-things-revolution-is-just-getting\/article_be0e928a-7148-5bcd-9b88-7ff2e5c36044.html\" target=\"_blank\">200 billion connected devices<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That\u2019s 200 billion &#8212; as in twice the number of stars in the Milky Way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of factors driving this incredible growth. As technology costs fall, it\u2019s easier for manufacturers to create Wi-Fi capable products. At the same time, smart phones \u2013 with Internet connectivity \u2013 are becoming the standard communication device. Industry leaders like Apple are already integrating fitness trackers, televisions, and mp3 players into the IoT, with many players expected to follow suit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, even with these bold predictions and trends pointing towards the IoT as the next big thing, there\u2019s still not much awareness of the concept among the general public \u2013 even those who use it on a daily basis. In fact, according to Forbes magazine,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">87 percent of people either do not understand or have not heard of the Internet of Things (IoT)<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The potential for growth is huge<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a software developer this should sound like music to your ears. As the app store continues to bloat\u00a0with over one and half million games, trackers, and timewasters, IoT presents\u00a0a whole new playing field\u00a0for you to branch out. By comparison, there are only<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,000 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.knowyourmobile.com\/devices\/apple-tv-2015\/23346\/best-apple-tv-apps-right-now\" target=\"_blank\">apps offered for the Apple TV<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10,000 for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wareable.com\/apple-watch\/best-apple-watch-apps-832\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To break into the IoT, become an expert in a field that\u2019s still untapped. If you spend the next five years with an <\/span>app development company<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> creating software and apps for showers or toaster ovens, chances are no one will know more about your niche than you do. The IoT is so multifaceted that it\u2019s impossible for the major players to cover every device. It\u2019s an absolute goldmine for a <\/span>custom mobile app development company<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest thing to remember, should your software, app, or other IoT creation take off, is to ensure scalability. While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/startups\" target=\"_blank\">research and development<\/a> are important in early stages, it\u2019s important to plan for best-case contingencies. Will you be ready when the order for a million units comes in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s incredible potential in the IoT so long as you understand how it works and where you can fit in. What a time to be alive!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the new Internet. It is the next logical stage in the evolution of data networks.
