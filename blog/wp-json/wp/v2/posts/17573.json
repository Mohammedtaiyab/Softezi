So, a solutions architect should be able to clearly explain, understand everyone\u2019s point of view, listen, advise, and influence.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Project and Resource Management.<\/b> Although a solutions architect is not directly involved in project development, they still need to ensure that project resources are being used efficiently and impactfully.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>They should be business-minded, capable of identifying the most effective solution at every turn, for every part of the architecture. It is their responsibility to focus on business goals, including hiring new people, and understand how to achieve them in the set timeframe and within the given budget.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>In-depth Analysis.<\/b> Software architecture and systems integrated into it are numerous details that work together. A solutions architect needs to be very attentive to those details, as overlooking something may hinder the development process, lead to breakdowns, or make the software solution inefficient.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>They also should be able to understand the technical specifications of many different software solutions and hardware and perform analysis of different business layers. The solutions architect is also responsible for the project context from the very beginning to the current moment.
