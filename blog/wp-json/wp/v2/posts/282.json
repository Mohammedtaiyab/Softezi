Each possesses its own distinct features, and is\u00a0right for particular kinds of\u00a0projects. This article briefly examines both models to\u00a0help you understand which is\u00a0right for your development needs.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Waterfall<\/h2>\n<p>Waterfall methodology is\u00a0akin to\u00a0a\u00a0meticulous plan in\u00a0which every stage of\u00a0development, from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/architecture\">conceptualization<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/design-lab\">design<\/a>, development, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/qa-testing\">testing<\/a>, is\u00a0all laid out in\u00a0a\u00a0static framework. The hours are calculated and the client pays an\u00a0agreed-upon fee for the project.<\/p>\n<p>This kind of\u00a0methodology works when you need something that\u2019s been done before. Payment systems, databases, CRM systems are all great examples of\u00a0software projects that may best be\u00a0suited to\u00a0a\u00a0waterfall development model.<\/p>\n<h2>Agile<\/h2>\n<p>Agile development is\u00a0just that: agile, and flexible. Agile development methodology consists of\u00a0the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/technical-program-management\">planning stage<\/a> and then developing the software throughout a\u00a0series of\u00a0brief iterations, usually referred to\u00a0as\u00a0sprints. The sprints typically last from two to\u00a0four weeks each, and at\u00a0the end of\u00a0each sprint, the client has the opportunity to\u00a0evaluate progress thus far, experience a\u00a0working prototype with functionality, and call for changes if\u00a0necessary.<\/p>\n<p>When it\u00a0comes to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/mobile-development\">mobile application development<\/a>, Agile methodology is\u00a0better suited to\u00a0apps that require a\u00a0bit more creativity and offer the possibility for extended functionality and user customization (which is\u00a0all apps). Changes can be\u00a0implemented at\u00a0any time, alterations can be\u00a0made, and functionality can be\u00a0added: all with minimal addition to\u00a0the original cost-estimate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So\u00a0which is\u00a0better?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When deciding the answer to\u00a0this question, one must understand that software development is\u00a0a\u00a0relatively young industry. It\u00a0is\u00a0still growing into itself, and the very nature of\u00a0this uniquely dynamic industry is\u00a0changing the way projects must be\u00a0managed.<\/p>\n<p>Waterfall methodology, it\u00a0may be\u00a0fair to\u00a0say, is\u00a0a\u00a0relic from an\u00a0earlier stage. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/about\">Software development companies<\/a> relied on\u00a0this business model because, well, that\u2019s just the way things have always been done. For the past ~100 years, businesses have been executing projects in\u00a0the waterfall fashion: meticulous planning followed by\u00a0execution and testing, then going back to\u00a0fix things as\u00a0a\u00a0whole.<\/p>\n<p>Agile methodology presents an\u00a0alternative that is\u00a0more compatible with the Digital Age. Since consumer electronics and software has grown to\u00a0the point of\u00a0global use and massive integration with all spheres of\u00a0life, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/technological-services\">software development<\/a> has reached a\u00a0point where it\u00a0develops organically as\u00a0the result of\u00a0feedback from user experience and continued development.<\/p>\n<p>This is\u00a0why Agile methodology is\u00a0the stronger choice: it\u00a0facilitates future change on\u00a0the\u00a0go. Such a\u00a0technique ultimately saves the product owner time and money, and leaves the project\u2019s development open for future changes (of\u00a0which there will be\u00a0no\u00a0shortage).<\/p>\n<p>While waterfall once had its place in\u00a0software development, it\u2019s truly no\u00a0longer necessary. The agile model is\u00a0a\u00a0product-centric model that focuses more on\u00a0client satisfaction and efficient development than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/technical-program-management\">project management<\/a> dogma. It\u2019s simply common sense. Trust us, we\u00a0know what we\u2019re talking about.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the world of software development, two primary development models reign: Agile vs. Waterfall.
