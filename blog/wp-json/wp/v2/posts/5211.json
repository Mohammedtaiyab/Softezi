Digital twin technology uses computer-aided design (usually, on the product development stage) or digitalises physical objects to provide or extract that information. For this data to be comprehensive, digital twins also gather it from enterprise business systems and external sources, like third-party software of a vendor (read our article about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/advanced-imaging-algorithms-for-digital-twin-reconstruction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital twin technology in construction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn more).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>New Information-Delivery Paradigm<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The authors of the augmented reality guide argue that AR allows for transforming how we structure, manage, and deliver data on the internet. The technology helps solve an issue everyone is familiar with: to use 2-D information we found on the web in the real world, we have to mentally translate it for use in a 3-D world. The best example is fixing something using a manual: one always has to shift between the object and the manual, which at the very least leads to quick mental exhaustion. In short, it is simply inefficient. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Example of an AR heads-up display<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5212\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays.png\" alt=\"augmented reality smart glasses\" width=\"850\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays.png 850w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays-300x167.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays-768x426.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays-600x333.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays-450x250.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Courtesy of hbr.org<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an AR smartphone or tablet app won\u2019t make this and similar processes significantly easier, augmented reality smart glasses will. The guide also mentions heads-up displays which come in, for example, AR windshields that provide GPS navigation and other important information to drivers with zero-to-none distractions. Such displays are already available in dozens of car models. The industrial impact of AR displays in general is bigger still.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Case #1: Newport News Shipbuilding<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Process<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Final inspection in ship construction; marking steel structures that are not part of the finished carrier in AR<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Issue<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Builders needed to constantly consult complex 2-D blueprints<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Device<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Dedicated headset<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>AR\u2019s Impact<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Inspection time reduced by 96% (from 36 hours to 90 minutes)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>Key Capabilities of AR<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abundantly detailing practical uses of augmented reality, Porter and Heppelmann list AR features that significantly elevate the process where the technology is applied.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>1.<\/strong><b>Visualisation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR software and devices allow the user to see internal features of an object or individual in a fashion of X-ray vision.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Case #2: AccuVein, medical device company<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Process<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Vascular procedures like blood draws<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>AR Solution:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> AR converts the heat signature of a patient\u2019s veins into an image that is superimposed on the skin, making the veins easier for doctors to locate<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Device<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Dedicated headset<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>AR\u2019s Impact<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Reduces escalations (for example, calling for assistance) by 45%; triples the likelihood of successful needlestick on the first try<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5219 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1073722691-1.jpg\" alt=\"augmented reality for organizations\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1073722691-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1073722691-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1073722691-1-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1073722691-1-600x401.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1073722691-1-450x301.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>2. Instruction and guidance<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR provides real-time, on the spot, and step-by-step visual guidance on tasks like assembly, machine operation, and warehouse picking. The information is presented on a display or in interactive 3-D holograms that walk the user through a process. This increases efficiency, speed, precision, and lowers costs for any operation all at once.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Case #3: Boeing<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Process<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Aircraft assembly<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>AR Solution:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 50-step AR training for wing assembly (30 parts)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Device<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Dedicated headset<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>AR\u2019s Impact<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 35% less time spent compared to using drawings and documentation; number of trainees with little or no experience who can perform the task correctly for the first time increased by 90%<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>3. Interaction<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile devices and smart apps have been gradually replacing our usual, physical means of controlling objects \u2014 button, knobs, even built-in touch screens. AR contributes to further transformation of these interactions. Comprehensive AR interfaces will be superimposed on products and used with AR headsets along with hand gestures and voice commands. For example, a factory employee would walk past machines on a manufacturing line, see their performance statistics, and make adjustments without physically interacting with them. The capability is nascent, but there solid examples exist. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Case #4: GE<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Process<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Turbine wiring<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>AR Solution:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Voice-command AR experience<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Device<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Dedicated headset<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>AR\u2019s Impact<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 34% productivity increase<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>The Value of Augmented Reality for Organizations <\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter and Heppelmann write that AR creates business value in two ways: AR as a product feature and AR solutions in the value chain across industries. The latter gets significantly more coverage. The reason isn\u2019t hard to pin down: enterprises are more interested in custom AR solutions that are built to solve their specific goals and go a long way. Compared to implementation of other technologies across branched enterprise infrastructures, AR solutions show impactful results in short term. The benefits of augmented reality are clear, supplied with impressive metrics and positive feedback from employees. When it comes to business, AR is a very comfortable technology: even if you invest a lot in it, you see the return on that investment very quickly. The aforementioned Boeing is a prominent example, as this video <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qTblKJjTadQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shows<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, AR as a feature has a secondary priority in the enterprise. As of today, there are only a few exceptions. The guide mentions that heads-up displays have been a key feature in fighter jets, which are in the elite military products niche, as well as commercial aircrafts. Meantime, the automotive industry only started supplying the latest vehicle models with these displays. They have yet to become cost-effective so much so that a company like DHL would invest in installing them into delivery vehicles. As of now, companies start with AR in operations of higher priority (for DHL it is logistics, a case we will look at further).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, AR as a feature will continue to create additional value in industries like education (for example visualising human body or planets with apps) and entertainment (AR games or installation on events). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let\u2019s take a look at how AR helps across the value chain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>Product Development <\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to AR, engineers, designers, and architects had to use computer-aided design (CAD) tools to create a product model. Conceptualising those designs in full proved constraining on computer screens. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Augmented reality technology allows them to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Superimpose 3-D models they created on the physical world as holograms. This unties the creator\u2019s hands, allowing them to significantly improve and evaluate a design.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Superimpose 3-D models on physical prototypes to see how well do they match.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><b><i>Quick Use Case<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Volkswagen use this tool to check alignment in digital design reviews, which improved the efficiency of the process and made it five to ten times faster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>Manufacturing<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of manufacturing processes are complex, and a mistake is often costly. Augmented reality for organizations that rely on assembly lines helps to address these challenges:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delivers the right information in the moment when it\u2019s needed on the line<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Captures information from from automation and control systems, secondary sensors, and asset management systems, and delivers monitoring and diagnostic data to an AR-enabled device of a factory employee. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><b><i>Quick Use Case<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Iconics, who specialise in automation software for factories and buildings, has began to integrate AR into their products and user interfaces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>Logistics<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The guide\u2019s authors point out that workers in most warehouses still consult paper lists to collect things and search for them. Slow and error-prone, the picking process amounts to up to 65% of warehouse costs in logistics. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>DHL<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> addresses this challenge by providing the workers with AR instructions that direct them to the location of an item and the best root to it. The result is fewer errors, higher worker engagement, and a 25% productivity gain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR helped <\/span><b>Intel<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reduce picking time by 29%, as the error rate fell to almost zero. The solution also allowed new Intel workers immediately achieve the required picking speed 15% faster than \u00a0compared to traditional training. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5220\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1034785948-1.jpg\" alt=\"augmented reality technology\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1034785948-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1034785948-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1034785948-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1034785948-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1034785948-1-450x300.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h2><b>Marketing &amp; Sales<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR solves a long-standing problem for businesses and their customers, allowing the latter to view what they are planning to buy in a real setting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR brings even more impactful benefits to marketing and sales:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More accurate expectations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More confidence about purchase decisions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greater product satisfaction<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduces the need for showrooms (Gap has already created an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/top-ten-ar-apps-history-mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR showroom app<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b><i>Quick Use Case<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: IKEA offers an app that allows the customers to see how products fit their home setting.

The technology can show factory workers predictive analytics data generated by a product, guide them through repairs in real-time, and connect them to remote experts who would provide help conveniently and quickly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, <\/span><b>Xerox<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> initially used AR to connect field engineers with experts, replacing telephone support and service manuals. As a result, first-time fix rates increased by 67% and an engineer\u2019s efficiency by 20%. Additionally, the average time it took to solve the issue dropped by two hours, lowering the need for staffing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xerox then took AR to the next level, and now connects the engineers directly with customers. With customer satisfaction rates rising to 95%, the company also increased the rate at which customers resolve issues without on-site help by 76%, cutting travel costs for Xerox and downtime for their customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>Augmented Reality Strategy \u2014 Q&amp;A<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The guide outlines five spot-on questions you need to ask to start with your augmented reality strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What is the range of AR opportunities in the industry, and in what sequence should they be pursued?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies should begin with weighing on the technology\u2019s potential impact on customers\/employees, product capabilities, and the value chain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>How will AR reinforce a company\u2019s product differentiation? <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR can extend product capabilities through companion experiences (like step-by-step guides or pre-recorded holograms), give more information, and increase product loyalty. AR can also differentiate your product by providing an interface that extends product functionality or makes it easier to use. In turn, such an interface will improve product service, support, and uptime. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The right differentiation would ultimately depend on your existing strategy, the strategies of your competitors, as well as the advent of AR itself.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>Where will AR have the greatest impact on cost reduction?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, you can significantly lower costs in manufacturing, product design, service, and training. Still, this doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t research how AR can improve other operations in your business. After all, the parts of the value chain mentioned above win from AR almost immediately. Other industries and operations can benefit from the technology not from the very start, for example <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/ar-solutions-for-construction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the construction industry<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The authors also underline that each company will need to align AR-driven cost-reduction with its strategic positioning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Should you invest into in-house AR capabilities, or wll outsourcing or partnering be sufficient?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The authors reckon that a company needs to build their own AR team if the technology is essential to their competitive advantage. In other cases, starting with outsourcing or finding an AR partner will suffice. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, outsourcing is a better option: building the full set of AR capabilities is challenging, and takes a significant amount of time and costs. More so, specialization emerges almost at every turn, while AR talent is in short supply. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, as AR vendors focus solely on the technology, they will compete between each other, constantly raising the bar on the quality of their offerings. In-house departments will have a hard time chasing after them due to the limited focus and tasks and, possibly, experimentation space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the authors expect that companies will eventually create AR teams to work in-house, just as every business did in the 1990s and 2000s with teams that build and run websites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>How will AR change communications with stakeholders?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR can complement the existing print and 2-D digital communication and has a huge potential to replace it completely. For example, stakeholders will put on augmented reality smart glasses for video calls instead of using laptops or smartphones, which introduces more flexibility and opportunities to cut costs. The authors also think that AR will fundamentally transform communication, comparing it to the internet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>Deploying AR \u2014 Q&amp;A<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The augmented reality guide lists five questions organizations need to address when implementing AR.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Which development capabilities will be required?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building an AR app like the aforementioned IKEA catalogue application is relatively easy. You will need mobile app development services with AR capabilities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need an instructions solutions like the one Boeing uses, you will need AR experts that can create and maintain dynamic 3-D digital content and have experience building solutions for AR headsets (like Microsoft HoloLens) or glasses (ODG R7).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want greater value through an interactive experience, you need AR experts that work with voice recognition and gestures and know how to integrate the solution with software that controls secure copy protocols (SCPs). Here, the abilities mentioned in the case above are also important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>How should companies create digital content for AR solutions?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. In the case of the most basic AR solution, the existing content can be repurposed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. For simple applications like an AR catalogue, you need to create only basic product representations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Instruction applications for tasks like machine repair require highly detailed product representations (digital twins). A company can create them by adapting CAD models or using 3-D scanning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>How will AR applications recognize the physical environment?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There several ways the technology can recognize a physical environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unregistered AR experience<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> determines the location of an AR device with, for example, GPS to display relevant information about that location without anchoring it to an object. Vehicle heads-up display work this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Registered AR experience<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> anchors information to an object through markers like barcodes, logos, or labels, which can be scanned with an AR device. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another version of this experience<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recognizes an object by comparing its shapes to a catalogues of 3-D models.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What AR hardware is required?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR experiences for big consumer audiences commonly involve <\/span><b>smartphones<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while companies use <\/span><b>tablets<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to leverage bigger screens and more processing and graphic power. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more powerful and comprehensive contextual experiences, industries like automotive and military use <\/span><b>heads-up displays<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the guide mentions <\/span><b>AR headsets and glasses as devices<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that will be most common in the enterprise when they become more affordable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for augmented reality strategy and hardware, most companies should take a <\/span><b>cross-platform approach<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that allows for deploying different smartphone and tablet brands and ensures the company will be ready to deploy the headsets or glasses in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Should you use a software development or a content-publishing model?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are planning to create an AR experience that would serve a number of purposes for a limited time (for example, an event app), and you don\u2019t plan to change its digital content, the software development model is your option. Still, you should note that, in order to change the digital content, developers would need to rewrite the entire app. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need it the other way around, the content-publishing model allows to create AR content and store it in the cloud. This option enables you to change the content without changing the software, as well as makes the content available across the organization. In other words, this is your cloud word processor, only for AR content. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Augmented Reality for Organizations: Statistics<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5214\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-1.png\" alt=\"augmented reality strategy\" width=\"850\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-1.png 850w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-1-300x241.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-1-768x616.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-1-600x481.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-1-450x361.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Courtesy of hbr.org<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5215\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-3-Enterprise-roles.png\" alt=\"augmented reality guide\" width=\"777\" height=\"602\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-3-Enterprise-roles.png 850w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-3-Enterprise-roles-300x232.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-3-Enterprise-roles-768x595.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-3-Enterprise-roles-600x464.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-3-Enterprise-roles-450x348.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Courtesy of hbr.org<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5217\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-2-Headsets.png\" alt=\"Microsoft HoloLens\" width=\"850\" height=\"502\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-2-Headsets.png 850w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-2-Headsets-300x177.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-2-Headsets-768x454.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-2-Headsets-600x354.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-2-Headsets-450x266.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Courtesy of hbr.org<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5218\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-4-Strategic-Goals.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"790\" height=\"503\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-4-Strategic-Goals.png 850w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-4-Strategic-Goals-300x191.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-4-Strategic-Goals-768x489.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-4-Strategic-Goals-600x382.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AR-Post-Graph-4-Strategic-Goals-450x286.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Courtesy of hbr.org<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although in its young years, augmented reality for organizations has already showed itself as a tool that solves long-standing enterprise issues.
