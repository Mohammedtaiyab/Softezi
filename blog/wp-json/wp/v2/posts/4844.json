In recent years, the company has been actively exploring the potential of the DLT industry for enterprises: high security, transparency and efficiency. During this period, Intellectsoft has completed a number of blockchain projects, including a mobile proximity payments platform on top of a Bitcoin platform, an ecommerce tokenization platform, and a P2P and cross-border payments system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company\u2019s expertise, the emergence of IBM-certified blockchain experts, and the immense value of distributed ledgers created the need for a stand-alone development laboratory.
