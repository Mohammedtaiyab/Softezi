As discussed above, an IoT unit can be considered as a device with a sensor that can interact with the physical world and send information to the Internet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>In healthcare, these devices can gather different patient data and receive inputs from health practitioners.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> An Internet of Things Healthcare example is continuous glucose monitoring for insulin pens that works effectively for patients with diabetes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these devices are able to communicate with each other and in some cases take important actions that would provide timely help or even save a life. For example, an IoT healthcare device can make intelligent decisions like calling the healthcare facility if an elderly person has fallen down. After collecting passive data, an IoT healthcare device would send this critical information to the cloud so that doctors can act upon it \u2014 view the general patient status, see if calling an ambulance is necessary, what type of help is required, and so on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, Internet of Things Healthcare can greatly improve not only a patient\u2019s health and help in critical situations, but also the productivity of health employees and hospital workflows.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How IoT helps in healthcare \u2014 Process\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s explore an IoT healthcare workflow example:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sensor collects data from a patient or a doctor\/nurse inputs data.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An IoT device analyzes the collected data with the help of AI-driven algorithms like machine learning (ML).\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The device makes a decision whether to act or send the information to the cloud.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctors, health practitioners, or even robots are enabled to make actionable and informed decisions based on the data provided by the IoT device.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IoT Devices in Healthcare<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although not all IoT devices should have a sensor, they at least need to have a radio and a given TCP\/IP address to enable communication with the Internet.

Still, this entails a number of challenges.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Challenges of IoT in Healthcare.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although IoT in healthcare provides many great benefits, there are also some challenges that need to be solved. The Internet of Things Healthcare solutions cannot be considered for implementation without acknowledging these challenges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Massive inputs of generated data.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Having thousands of devices in a single healthcare facility and a thousand more sending information from remote locations \u2014 all in real-time \u2014 will generate huge amounts of data. The data generated from IoT in healthcare will likely make storage requirements grow much higher, from Terabytes to Petabytes. If used properly, AI-driven algorithms and cloud can help make sense of and organize this data, but this approach needs time to mature. So, creating a large-scale IoT healthcare solution will take a lot of time and effort.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IoT devices will increase the attack surface. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IoT healthcare bring numerous benefits to the industry, but they also create numerous vulnerable security spots. Hackers could log into medical devices connected to the Internet and steal the information \u2014\u00a0 or even modify it. They can also take a step further and hack an entire hospital network, infecting the IoT devices with the infamous Ransomware virus. That means the hackers will hold patients and their heart-rate monitors, blood pressure readers, and brain scanners as hostages.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Existing software infrastructure is obsolete. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IT infrastructures in many hospitals are obsolete.
