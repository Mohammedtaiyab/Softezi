Their backbone consists of lists and ratings of software development companies, which include all the essential information: profile, cases studies, reviews, hourly rates, average project budget, and more. In addition, they serve as hubs for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/app-developers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app developers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where you can browse through and participate in forum discussions for unexaggerated reviews, insights, and other useful information.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>If a company has the top spot in Google, it doesn\u2019t mean they are established <\/i><i>app developers<\/i><i>.
