Most people will (at\u00a0times begrudgingly) pay it, meaning that they\u2019ll drop between fifteen and twenty-five dollars a\u00a0week just on\u00a0their morning drinks. Interestingly enough, most of\u00a0those same individuals are hesitant to\u00a0spend more than $1.00 on\u00a0a\u00a0mobile application that they might use every day for months\u2014if not years.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the ones that do\u00a0spend that dollar have disproportionate expectations on\u00a0what their ninety-nine cents should afford them.<\/p>\n<p>For their one dollar purchase, most users seem to\u00a0expect:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Infinite updates<\/li>\n<li>Timely, and infinite customer support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For any other industry in\u00a0the world this would be\u00a0laughably absurd, and yet somehow it\u00a0has gained widespread acceptance in\u00a0the world of\u00a0mobile apps. It\u2019s unreasonable, but it\u2019s how mobile users have been conditioned since the dawn of\u00a0the app store. You may have spent tens of\u00a0thousands of\u00a0dollars and hours to\u00a0get your app to\u00a0completion, but the user can\u2019t really see this\u2014and in\u00a0truth, he\u00a0doesn\u2019t care. The average user of\u00a0the average mobile device sees only his immediate needs, and he\u00a0sees an\u00a0ocean of\u00a0apps that can meet those needs. Sometimes a\u00a0dollar just seems too expensive.<\/p>\n<p>So\u00a0let\u2019s say you DO\u00a0lock in\u00a0the clients, even with a $1.99 or\u00a0higher price tag, you\u2019ll only get that money from them once, and yet you\u2019ll be\u00a0expected to\u00a0make sure the app is\u00a0working properly, up-to-date with regular changes, and the users\u2019 emails are answered\u2026indefinitely. In\u00a0more extreme cases, I\u2019ve heard of\u00a0developers getting refund requests from users because the mobile app was made free a\u00a0year after the original purchase\u2026A YEAR! So\u00a0that means the user downloaded and used the app for an\u00a0entire year and yet, because it\u00a0was made free at\u00a0some distant later point, they felt \u201cripped off\u201d if\u00a0they didn\u2019t get their $.99 back.<\/p>\n<p>Sooner or\u00a0later your client market will be\u00a0saturated, and you\u2019ll need to\u00a0figure out how to\u00a0generate ongoing revenue, and of\u00a0course the answer isn\u2019t always as\u00a0simple as\u00a0offering advertising. As\u00a0mentioned before, users have been conditioned to\u00a0expect a\u00a0one-time purchase at\u00a0an\u00a0absurdly low price that entitles them to\u00a0years of\u00a0support and updates.<\/p>\n<p>Even in\u00a0desktop computers, people are more than willing to\u00a0shell out twenty, forty, or\u00a0even hundreds of\u00a0dollars for software\u2026and yet something is\u00a0different with mobile devices. Perhaps it\u2019s the temporality of\u00a0it\u00a0all, how it\u00a0seems that hardware is\u00a0constantly being updated, and the device for which they paid hundreds of\u00a0dollars is\u00a0becoming increasingly obsolete every day.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, users need to\u00a0be\u00a0reconditioned from this mindset. Users need to\u00a0understand and appreciate the hard work that goes into the development of\u00a0applications, and the incredible value of\u00a0something that they use even a\u00a0few times a\u00a0week, let alone every day, sold at\u00a0such a\u00a0low price.<\/p>\n<p>Generating long term revenue can be\u00a0done through subscriptions, in-app purchases, and ads, but users get fed up\u00a0with all of\u00a0those things. They don\u2019t feel they need to\u00a0pay more than once.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most people are hesitant to spend more than $1.00 on a mobile application that they might use every day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":63,"featured_media":3260,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 -
