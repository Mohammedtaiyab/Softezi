Former software devs and sites makers now appeared in a new trendy role of apps developers. So, if you\u2019re sure you need a mobile application, it\u2019s time to choose developer to perform it. How should you orientate in this sea of proposals?<\/p>\n<p>Here are some points which are worth to pay attention while choosing a developer for your mobile app.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Narrow the range of possible developers<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s assume you are new to this sphere and you got any person to ask advice. \u00a0What should you do?<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Rely on references<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ask those from your friends or business partners who already did an app. It\u2019s simple, and it gives you a lot of information. But if you got only one person in your environment who is more experienced in developing, this is not enough.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Take expert\u2019s advice<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ask expert in mobile area about reliable developers. You can reach experts in this field on conferences, workshops, reading their articles etc. The only thing you should do is contacting them.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Use specialized catalogues<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Searching through Google or Yahoo won\u2019t give you the exact result quickly: first positions are usually taken by companies which pay more attention at SEO rather than development. It\u2019s better to search through specialized catalogues like Themakeapps.com, Mobiledevelopersdirectory.com, Studiolist.org etc.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Draw the short-list of developers<\/h3>\n<p><strong><em>Select the right price<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course your company ain\u2019t got $1M to spent on mobile apps developing.<\/p>\n<p>But even if your company is young and rather small, don\u2019t be tempted with the lowest rates on market.<\/p>\n<p>It could lead not only to non-qualitative performance but to the situation with the project underestimation. Thus you can find yourself with a poor application and twice exceeded budget.<br \/>\nSo, remember, do not \u00a0choose the cheapest rates\/ price on market. It\u2019s always better to choose among the companies you trust, even if their rates or preliminary estimation will be higher than you\u2019ve expected.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Pay attention at developer\u2019s location<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most of our clients and partners advice to be careful when dealing with unknowing companies from India or Middle East. Their prices could be attractive, also maybe you\u2019ve heard the successful stories about developing there. But in majority of cases finally you got not that product you\u2019ve expected for.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Choose experienced companies<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It passed a little time since Android and iPhone smartphones appeared, so your contractor cannot have 10-years\u2019 experience in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/mobile-app-development-services\">mobile apps development<\/a>. But it would be better if company was experienced in developing other software before they started mobile apps. The best level of experience starts from 3-4 years and about 30 projects performed.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Look through the portfolio<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Quick look through the company\u2019s portfolio will give you an understanding of their qualification and experience. It could not contain apps which you know, but overall impression is extremely important.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Ask them to quote the price<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s simple &#8211; choose those companies which are ready to name approx. price project of the project (and specify what it is consists of).<br \/>\nEven if a company works on a hourly based billing, they should be able to specify the cost.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Choose the only one<\/h3>\n<p><strong><em>See how quickly company gave the response<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u0421ompanies should appreciate their clients: communicate only with those who gave the answer within 2-3 days. Estimation also should not take more than 2-3 days.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Ask about their organization structure<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ask how many employees company got in-house and how many freelancers, if they got specialized testing department etc. The best team work and quick results come out from synergy of in-house specialists<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6010\" title=\"app development stanfy\" src=\"https:\/\/stanfy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/banner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"626\" height=\"338\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Estimate their business approach<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Watch how the development company investigated your business situation.<br \/>\nDid they ask any questions before they give you the price? Did they try to deepen in solving your business problem\/try to validate your mobile solution?<br \/>\nIf the answer is no, and if they are not really trying to understand client\u2019s needs, it means they cannot suggest really valuable solutions for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Evaluate their developm<\/em><em>ent process<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ask them about development process in company. You may not understand all the details, but the way how developer describes it is already important to understand if they got passion for work.<br \/>\nTesting is also an important question &#8211; how the company handles testing, how many devices they have etc. The more devices they\u2019ve got, the less bugs your users find; it is especially important for developing on Android with its devices variety.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>After launch support<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What happens after your app is ready? Does developer offer some kind of support or test period for fixing all the bugs for free? It is also important to assure you won\u2019t pay any licence payments and all material rights for the app will go to you.<\/p>\n<h3>Resume<\/h3>\n<p>Choosing mobile developer is not one-day business and you should not approach to it as a simple task.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s more like choosing a spouse for a long-term relations.<\/p>\n<p>Do not send hundreds of quotes for all developers those contacts you could find.<br \/>\nJust select several of them through validation scheme. All the propositions received for your quote you should evaluate with attention. Pay attention at company\u2019s passion to their business and willing to help you.<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing, despite of developer\u2019s experience and good prices, is that you should trust the company.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since application markets became a source of a good income for savvy app owners, many developers came to this market.
