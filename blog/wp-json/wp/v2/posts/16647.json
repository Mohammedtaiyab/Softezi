From ultimate personalization with DNA testing, to sophisticated sleep technology, to smarter houses for Parkinson\u2019s disease patients, let\u2019s explore how connected devices will change the healthcare industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Connected Wellness Devices<\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evolution of Device Ecosystems<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying fit and healthy is the main driver of modern lifestyles. Here, smart IoT devices for wellness have become our helpers. Connected gadgets provide and gather important information, motivate us, and even serve as our trainers, among other things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, the vast majority of people who exercise and closely monitor their health have at least a smart watch or bracelet alongside their smartphones and fitness apps, which all work together in one ecosystem. Although they have long become essential to modern exercise routines, as technologies continue to evolve, the role these devices play will only keep growing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16648\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Connected health devices\" width=\"655\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-450x300.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-1000x667.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The foundation for these developments is already in place. The Apple and Fitbit IoT ecosystems are already so vast that can use advanced algorithms to provide their users with spot-on insights and workout recommendations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the latest Apple Watch model has an ECG feature, we can also expect future IoT devices would perform checks that are currently possible only in medical facilities, gathering even more information and providing even better recommendations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wellness Devices will Reach Ultimate Personalization<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Existing IoT wellness devices gather many types of data and provide deeply personalized recommendations to users, Still, the highest level of personalization will be enabled by more sophisticated means that rely heavily on IoT technology. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skulpt.me\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skulpt<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> developed a scanning device that allows users to analyse fat-to-muscle ratio and muscle health individually. The information is sent to the Skulpt app, as it performs an in-depth analysis and then offers users individual recommendations for safe and efficient workouts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, reaching the highest level of personalization can only be enabled by solutions based on <\/span><b>DNA testing<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With properly developed AI-driven algorithms, these connected health and wellness devices will provide truly individual workout and diet recommendations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fitnessgenes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FitnessGenes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the existing examples. The company offers a three-step DNA analysis of vascular function, sleep cycles, saturated fat sensibilities, energy production, and other. After, the FitnessGenes app offers the user a genetically tailored nutrition plan and workout advice. As users continue to demand increasingly personalised products and services, health and wellness devices driven by DNA testing will be widely popular in the coming years.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New Life of Group Fitness<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small but highly effective, IoT sensors will gain more traction in fitness as well, especially group-focused exercises. Placed on each participant, the battery-powered wireless sensors will gather information and stream it to a TV screen or a trainer\u2019s mobile device, in real-time. This way, the participants could follow the progress of others, while trainers can better cater to each client on-the-go. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of data sharing, people love sharing their sports achievements with others, as well as connect with fellow fitness enthusiasts. So, apps like Strava will remain popular in the coming years, while also giving way to more curious solutions. For example, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">xMed<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows users to diagnose health issues in two ways. First, it has AI-driven algorithms. Second, it serves us a social media network where users can ask fellow health and wellness enthusiasts for advice \u2014 or connect with medical experts. Smart watches and bracelets are in the equation, of course (learn more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/cases\/xmed-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16649\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Group-fitness-class-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Wellness devices\" width=\"649\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Group-fitness-class-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Group-fitness-class-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Group-fitness-class-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Group-fitness-class-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Group-fitness-class-450x300.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Group-fitness-class-1000x667.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better Sleep<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep deprivation has emerged as a widespread modern malaise. Scientists, public figures, and popular media outlets ring red alert on our bedtime habits and the low numbers of our shut-eye hours. Arianna Huffington went as far as to branding sleep deprivation \u201cthe new smoking\u201d in a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3060801\/heres-arianna-huffingtons-recipe-for-a-great-night-of-sleep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast Company article<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as the condition causes a wide range of mental and physical health issues. Sound-based products providing ambient sounds do not seem to suffice anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Except a sleep robot, wellness medical devices powered by IoT technology have emerged as the solution. Products on this market <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90283063\/the-most-promising-health-and-wellness-trends-for-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">include<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sleep trackers, nighttime wearables, and smart pillows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This wellness connected devices include smart mattresses. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/eightsleep.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight Sleep<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a New York-based technology company, offers a comfortable mattress with IoT sensors, which gather data about fifteen sleep and health factors, and delivers it to the Eight Sleep app. The application also enables users to control the temperature of both sides of the bed. The latest version has an additional device called the Pod that can dynamically change the mattress temperature according to the gathered data about personal sleep temperature preferences for both sides of the bed. The solution can also be controlled with smart home systems like Alexa.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Connected Devices in Healthcare<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remote Wellness Monitoring Devices<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, hospitals and other medical institutions continue to struggle with high patient loads, as nurses face long extra hours. The problem will not go away anytime soon, at the very least. On top of that, finding funding remains an unsolved issue for many medical institutions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, IoT comes forward as the most fitting solution, and one of the major drivers of the industry\u2019s technological evolution. Connected health devices help solve healthcare\u2019s critical issues in an effective, patient-friendly, and cost-effective way, as well as introduce many other benefits and solutions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, the NHS (National Health Service) of the UK is currently at the second phase of testing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sabp.nhs.uk\/tihm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology Integrated Health Management<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (TIHM). The program reduces the number of hospital and home care admissions for dementia patients with a system of wellness monitoring devices, allowing them to comfortably stay at home for longer periods of time. The NHS installs the sensors in a patient\u2019s place of stay, allowing clinicians to monitor their health remotely 24\/7. The solution also involves artificial intelligence-driven algorithms, and can alert medical experts in a number of occasions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16653\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Greenhouse-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"health and wellness devices\" width=\"649\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Greenhouse-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Greenhouse-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Greenhouse-768x480.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Greenhouse-600x375.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Greenhouse-450x281.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Greenhouse-1000x625.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/builtin.com\/internet-things\/iot-in-healthcare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pfizer and IBM<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> went further with the concept to simplify the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease. The medical condition requires continuous assessment and medication regimen adjustments based on a patient\u2019s movements, cognitive responses, and a myriad of other factors. During their study, the companies placed IoT sensors on the majority of objects to monitor the symptoms and relay the data to clinicians, which in turn can make the needed adjustments to the medication routine, as well as stay informed about the patient\u2019s condition around the clock. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution also leverages mobile devices and advanced machine learning capabilities. Pfizer and IBM strive to help people with Parkinson\u2019s disease lead their lifestyles without being confined to a hospital while also gather data and streamline the patient management process. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As taking care of patients with serious long-standing diseases is problematic in the face of overcrowded and busy hospitals, solutions with connected health devices can save medical institutions costs and significantly reduce (or even eliminate) the nurses\u2019 extra hours. Due to their invisible and user-friendly nature, connected health devices have a very short learning curve. More so, they allow hospitals to provide patients with the best type of comfort \u2014 the comfort of their homes. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16661\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pills-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"wellness connected devices\" width=\"651\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pills-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pills-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pills-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pills-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pills-450x300.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pills-1000x667.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart Medication Management<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring vaccines are kept at the right temperature at all times is critical. All the more so if they are dispatched to hard-to-reach regions with deadly diseases and a high demand for the cure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address this issue, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/builtin.com\/internet-things\/iot-in-healthcare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexleaf Analytics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> created ColdTrace \u2014 a remote temperature monitoring system for vaccine refrigerators in rural healthcare organizations. An IoT sensor is installed into a refrigerator unit to monitor temperature and grid power, and the connected health devices system sends updates and alerts to the monitoring personnel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for more mundane situations, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.adheretech.com\/how-it-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AdhereTech<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> created a Smart Pill Bottle to ensure a person does not fall out of their medication routine.
