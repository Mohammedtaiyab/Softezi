For now, this is neither good nor bad, as the gambling industry is unique in its own right: while the digital economy continues to bite at real-life experiences across industries, land casinos remain popular and online gambling has simply become a new dimension of the classic casino experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The business definitely keeps pace with the times \u2014 land casinos seen a fair share of enhancements throughout the years while live-streamed online gambling now resembles the real-life experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the gambling industry has been lagging behind in adoption of technologies that simplify operations, cut costs, and remove roadblocks in the customer experience. Today, many casinos don\u2019t even use accounting software, moving winnings is highly uncomfortable, all the while online and land casinos are disintegrated. As modern users demand a simpler and faster experience, the casino business will have to face all these issues at once sooner or later.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From blockchain-based accounting and cash outs in cryptocurrency or tokenized fiat, to enforcing responsible gaming, let&#8217;s explore the ways blockchain helps to solve the biggest casino industry challenges and help it evolve in a meaningful way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain Based Casino Accounting, Cash-In\/Cash-Out &amp; Casino Cryptocurrency<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accounting is the crux of casino management. Still, many land casinos approach their financial affairs and cash-in\/cash-out management in a straightforward and, truth be told, downright obsolete way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is how the cash-in\/cash-out process looks in some gaming houses during tournaments:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A player enters the casino using the established Know Your Customer (KYC) method;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verifies their identity at the cashier\u2019s desk to cash in\/cash out;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the requested sum exceeds the set limit, the cashier calls the manager;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The manager invites the player to their office;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a spreadsheet, the manager checks the player\u2019s balance, approves the transaction, and then adds to or subtracts from the total sum;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The manager gives out or accepts the player\u2019s cash.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such a first-hand approach may seem reliable when a cash-out of a big sum is in question, but systems like that still lack in flexibility, functionality, and security compared to accounting solutions in other industries. So, six steps in total, two steps of verification, and three employee encounters (count in the casino guard if the house\u2019s KYC includes them) separate the player from their money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some might say: if the system pulled through the times when every business transferred its operations to various software systems and legacy solutions, there must be a reason it still exists, and maybe casino accounting should be left well enough alone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But let\u2019s look a bit further.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a casino chain has properties and hosts tournaments across the world, accounting issues become all the more evident.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a person plays in a chain\u2019s property in a different country, transferring money is complicated, slow, and entails transactional fees. There is no simple way one can move big sums of money.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gambling laws differ from country to country. A player may win a substantial sum in a foreign country, but might not be able to cash out or transfer all of it back to the bank in the home country.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The player does not control their own money like they do in their bank\u2019s app.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The money is not liquid. If a player gambles in casinos of one chain, but they are located in different countries, they must make calls to verify the money are in one casino to access it in the other.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The player cannot borrow money, and if a player borrows money from another player, the operation cannot be tracked, as it is in cash.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s a big bag of challenges.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Blockchain Helps<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One blockchain solution can help casinos tackle all of the issues above. Let\u2019s look at an example. First, the casino\u2019s financial documents are moved to a blockchain ledger, which can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Second, a custom blockchain-based wallet is developed for players. Finally, a custom casino token is created for the house, allowing players to cash in and cash out the winnings to crypto, which can then be exchanged at a certain rate to the currency or crypto of the player\u2019s choice. So, a blockchain casino is also a cryptocurrency casino.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tying everything up is an access\/permission management system based on a KYC database and working on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/what-are-smart-contracts-blockchain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smart contracts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a set of pre-programmed automated actions that are a part of the blockchain. With smart contracts, employees would get a secured, limited and transparent access to the player\u2019s account to enable their transactions throughout the gaming process. If a player borrows from another player, the process is similarly secured, limited, transparent, and can be carried out in a few clicks in a dedicated mobile app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a player wants to cash in or cash out at one of the casinos, they would simply need to scan a QR code and verify the transaction with their fingerprint\/face on a tablet or mobile app of a casino employee (which would also be a part of the blockchain casino software). All of this will be managed by smart contracts in a matter of seconds and not require any actions from the users involved. All the transactions and user identities will be saved to the blockchain ledger, shared by all the casinos in the chain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This brings many benefits to casinos:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain basically unhackable, so the casino gets the highest level of financial security<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast cross-border transactions without fees in the blockchain network\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Players have full ownership of their money, as this information is registered on the blockchain ledger. The data cannot be tampered with in any way<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playable money becomes liquid and easier to manage<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain enables P2P transactions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biometric security (enabled by a mobile app).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Players can be allowed to borrow money from other players.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merging Land &amp; Online Casinos Into a Single Blockchain Casino<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many land-based casinos have extended their business online, but the land and online parts are disintegrated. This is an old norm in the gambling world. So, if a person plays Baccarat in a land-based house of one company and wants to continue playing at home after the visit, there will be no data shared between the online and land casino experiences. The player will have different accounts, balances, track records, loyalty points and bonuses, and so on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The root of the issue is similar to how accounting is managed in the industry \u2014 there is no software in the land casino while the software behind the online part is too old. Here, blockchain provides a solution that\u2019s similar to the accounting process, but with a twist. The processes powering up online and land casinos are transferred to a shared blockchain ledger, users access services on mobile devices and desktop, there may be a cryptocurrency or tokenized currency involved, and access management at different points of user experience is managed by smart contracts. All of this comprises a blockchain casino that connects both the physical and digital gambling worlds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what\u2019s the twist?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most casinos, the system behind the online part is too complicated and sensitive to new integrations. Casinos consider only a simple and light integration between online and physical experiences. On top of that, the process is risky: any bug or issue may lead to downtime. No matter how long it takes, any downtime in the gambling industry is extremely expensive to the business.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, online casinos are highly popular, most land casino players heavily use different cryptocurrencies, and casino management themselves acknowledges the need to make the transition and merge both experiences. In a time where businesses try to remove as many hurdles in their customer experiences as possible, merging online and land into seems like a long-delayed move. Like many industries before, the gambling business is just waiting for one major player to make a successful transformation into a blockchain casino, and then follow suit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enforcing Responsible Gambling on Blockchain<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some jurisdictions, for example Macao, impose daily gambling limits on players to prevent excessive gambling. Still, as online and land are disintegrated, the law works only as a sort of half-measure. One can gamble too much in a land casino, and then simply continue playing online.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enabling gambling on blockchain solves the issue. After land and online casinos are transferred to one blockchain ledger, a casino can enforce this policy across the chain. The data on time players spend in the casino will be saved to a single blockchain, and If a player exceeded one\u2019s limit online, the doors of the land casino will close for them \u2014 and vice versa.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The doors could close quite literally, as a blockchain casino can be connected to the security system: cameras will recognize those who exceeded their limit and block them access to the entrance. This concept can be extended to a gambling jurisdiction if all of its operators agree to be part of one open blockchain ledger.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain gambling can help players limit themselves as well (in some countries, this option is enforced by law). If a player binge-gambled for a certain period of time and spent a lot of money, they can choose to limit themselves for a set term by pressing a single button in the casino\u2019s app. The money will be securely locked by way of smart contracts until the end of the term, according to the law, and inaccessible to no one, including the player.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summing it Up: Blockchain in Casino Industry &amp; Gambling\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain can solve critical challenges of the casino industry in accounting, cash-in\/cash-out management, security, regulation, as well as bridge the gap between online and land experiences. Although the risks of replacing obsolete software with blockchain stops casinos from making a step towards meaningful digital transformation, the industry will still need to evolve to become more leaner, more secure, and address the demands of modern customers. The benefits of blockchain technology for gambling are evident, and the industry understands that, so we will definitely see how the blockchain casino concept becomes a reality in the near future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Explore how blockchain helps the casino industry face its most critical issues.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":61,"featured_media":16855,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[801],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"From accounting to merging land and online casinos, blockchain technology ushers the industry into the era of the blockchain-based casinos.
