Why Ukraine? The country has a number of good reasons to be included in the lists of top countries for outsourcing and we will discuss them in detail.<\/p>\n<h2>Software Developers: Ukraine as Outsourcing Talent Pool<\/h2>\n<p>Software development in Ukraine is growing and enhancing year by year. The number of software engineers in 2020 has reached 200k.<\/p>\n<p>The country is becoming a popular destination for software development outsourcing due to its beneficial and promising technical environment, effective education, and devoted employees.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>100 out of Fortune 500 corporations already have offshore development teams in Ukraine.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>20% of the world IT leaders choose Ukraine over other popular outsourcing destinations in Europe (Poland, Hungary, Romania, Belarus, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>The following aspects influence the decision to work with the Ukrainian IT market:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qualified and experienced professionals<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lower salary rates<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High-quality of delivered products and solutions<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convenient time zone<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Easy communication<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is no surprise that companies like Google, Samsung, ABBYY, NetCracker, eBay, Skype, etc. employ engineers to work on their projects.<\/p>\n<h3>The Number of Software Development Companies in Ukraine<\/h3>\n<p>Over the past 10 years, the number of IT companies has almost doubled. In 2009 there were 940 software companies and in 2020 the number is over 1600. The majority of these companies offer custom software development and provide their services to companies around the globe.<\/p>\n<p>Ukrainian companies mainly export their services to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the US market (80%)<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the UK (64%)<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Germany (60%)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Also, they cooperate with such countries as the Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, etc. The main focus is on eCommerce, education, telecom, finance, healthcare, and insurance domains.<\/p>\n<h2>Top 10 Reasons to Hire Developers in Ukraine<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Strong Educational Background<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22622\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Education-DOU.jpg\" alt=\"Education DOU\" width=\"897\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Education-DOU.jpg 897w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Education-DOU-300x148.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Education-DOU-768x379.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Education-DOU-600x296.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Education-DOU-450x222.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 897px) 100vw, 897px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: DOU<\/p>\n<p>Ukraine has a developed tech education system that guarantees its graduates get applicable knowledge, hands-on experience, and useful skills. The general literacy rate is almost 100% due to accessible education.<\/p>\n<p>Every year around 36k students graduate from universities with Bachelor\u2019s or Master\u2019s degrees. Statistics on DOU indicate that 80.1% of IT employees have higher education, 7% have two university degrees, 1.5% hold Ph.D., while only 2.1% have secondary education certificates, and 1.8% of specialists have been only to college.<\/p>\n<p>Universities have strong STEM programs as there have been and still are enterprises where a large number of engineers is needed.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, with the development of the IT industry and new technologies, colleges and universities have managed to adjust education to global trends and are able to provide high-quality education. STEM programs become more and more popular, as there is a great number of students who want to work in the IT field.<\/p>\n<p>Also, there is a great number of private institutions and courses where people can acquire new skills, change their occupation, or enhance their knowledge in a particular field.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Skill Diversity<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Apart from general college or university education, Ukrainian software developers pay much attention to self-education and always keep up with the latest industry trends.

The country is suitable for nearshore and offshore outsourcing, as it is close to different European cities and it is only 7 hours ahead of the USA.<\/p>\n<p>This is the reason why so many companies partner with the US IT businesses and some of them have their headquarters here. For instance, you live in the USA and you receive recent updates and reports in the morning. This helps to have no delays in project development and implementation.<\/p>\n<p>As for the companies in the EU, it will be convenient for you to schedule meetings online and even have regular on-site meetings with the offshore team, as it takes from 1.5 to 3.5 hours to fly to Kyiv.<\/p>\n<p>In case you need to travel to other cities in Ukraine, they have a well-developed infrastructure, so it is easy and convenient to travel to other IT hubs within the country by plane or by train.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Communication<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>How can you communicate with the Ukrainian teams if you don\u2019t know the language?

Here are the tips to follow:<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 1: Define Requirements for the Outsourcing Partner<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Make a list of the requirements for the outsourcing partner. It is important to have a clear image of the partner you want to work with.<\/p>\n<p>Ask your board to work on the requirements together, so every important detail is included. Think of the resources and tools a vendor should possess to complete the project successfully.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 2: Narrow Down Location<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Choose the city where you want to find the vendor. It will be more convenient to check the offices in one city, rather than travel around the country for on-site meetings.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 3: Choose Candidates\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>First, select 3-5 most suitable companies based on their services, years of experience, portfolio, team members, prices, etc.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 4: Read Reviews<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Before you make a final decision, pay attention to the customers\u2019 reviews. Contact your partners who have experience in outsourcing services and ask for their advice.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 5: Schedule Interviews\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Meet with the top 3 vendors you think are the best options for your company. It is better to have on-site meetings, so you have a full picture of the company. Interviews are also a great chance to get to know the CEO of the company and higher-management you could work with.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 6: Meet with Recruiter and Outline Team Structure<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Once the vendor is chosen, meet with the recruiter, and identify the team structure for the project. So, the vendor will choose the right candidates for the project and schedule the interviews with software developers.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 7: Check Technical Skills<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Make sure you meet with every candidate for the project and know who is going to be on your team. It is important to check the background of the employees, their education, years of experience, previous cases, etc.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 8: Pay Attention to Soft Skills<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Tech skills are important but don\u2019t forget to pay attention to communication skills. It is important for the candidate to know the norms of business communication and have a good command of the English language, as they have to work in an international team and communicate their ideas to their team members clearly.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 9: Introduce Offshore Team to In-House One\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Introduce your in-house and offshore teams to one another and make sure everyone knows their role on the project.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 10: Start the Project\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Now, when you have selected a suitable team and discussed all the administrative processes, you can start to build a project plan together and move on to the next stages.<\/p>\n<h2>Ukrainian Software Development Market in 2021.
