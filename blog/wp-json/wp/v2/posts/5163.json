Several years ago a start like this might have been common only to small to medium conferences, where ninety percent of participants are startups. Today, the trend has reached the most anticipated event in the user experience field \u2014 UXPA international 2018, which took place in Puerto Rico at Wyndham Rio Mar beach resort on 26-28 of June. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intellectsoft flew to the picturesque lands of the island as well: Anna Iurchenko, the experience designer of Intellectsoft Augmented Reality Lab, gave two presentations (a rare case for the conference) alongside designers from tech giants like Google and other professionals in the field. The attendees, speakers, and other guests not only delivered many interesting, educational, and thought-provoking talks, but also helped UXPA carry its spirit and friendly mood into yet another successful event. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Most Popular UX Conference in the World<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5165\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/UXPA-OUTSIDE.jpg\" alt=\"ux conference\" width=\"650\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/UXPA-OUTSIDE.jpg 938w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/UXPA-OUTSIDE-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/UXPA-OUTSIDE-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/UXPA-OUTSIDE-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/UXPA-OUTSIDE-450x300.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The attendees of UXPA 2018 network on the hotel&#8217;s grounds.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The annual event is hosted by the namesake organization UXPA (User Experience Professionals Association), whose community enlists 2400 members in 59 chapters located around the globe. Since its inception in 1991, the organization had established itself as a major force in the field of UX. The main mission of UXPA has always remained unchanged: support people who design, evaluate, and research user experience of design of products and services. To add to that, UXPA publishes their findings in their two magazines \u2014 Usability Studies and User Experience Magazine. Still, UXPA International Conference has become the main means of fulfilling the association\u2019s mission, becoming increasingly bigger and more popular year after year. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UXPA Conference 2018 Goes to New Highs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gathering designers and design researches from tech giants and big-name companies, this year\u2019s UXPA conference was here to prove and elevate its popularity one more time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the companies stressing the importance of user experience methodology, management, strategy, and principles across industries were Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Capital One, Uber, IBM, and Facebook. The speakers delivered an abundance of interesting talks connected to design in several categories: career development, design psychology, design innovation, interaction design, user experience tools, techniques, and best practices in the field; user experience strategy; and more. There were both advanced and entry level talks and panels, ranging from deep listening in user experience design research to web VR design to discussing the importance of academia-industry connection in the UX field. The workshops of UXPA had a similarly rich range. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5166\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA.jpg\" alt=\"UXPA conference\" width=\"651\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA.jpg 879w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA-300x214.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA-768x547.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA-600x427.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA-450x320.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Anna Iurchenko, the experience designer at our Augmented Reality Lab.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intellectsoft\u2019s presence was substantial, and came mainly in the success of Anna Iurchenko: her talk and poster presentation were picked from three hundred submissions, passing peer review and UXPA conference committee discussion stages. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How User Experience Saves Lives \u2014 Anna Iurchneko\u2019s Talk<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before transitioning to Experience Designer at Intellectsoft AR Lab, Anna was the Lead UX designer at Stanfy, an innovative San Francisco startup known for their highly effective, elaborately designed products (Intellectsoft has acquired Stanfy in 2016). Anna has spent four years designing healthcare products whose user base exceeds four million people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anna\u2019s talk \u2014 \u201cChanging Users Health Behavior Through Design\u201d \u2014 concerned user experience research, flow, and design process as much as behavioral psychology. First, Anna briefly charted through the history of health behaviour theories. Having it mapped out, Anna concluded that the Fogg Behavior Model is the the most fitting means to form a habit in a healthcare product. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5167\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presentation.jpg\" alt=\"user experience professionals association\" width=\"649\" height=\"415\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presentation.jpg 979w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presentation-300x192-1.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presentation-768x491-1.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presentation-600x384-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presentation-450x288-1.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Anna explains and illustrates the Fogg Model.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proposed by Dr. BJ Fogg, the founder of the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University, the model shows that three elements must converge at the same moment of time for a behavior to occur: motivation, ability, and trigger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After explaining the model, Anna quickly transitioned to showing an example where it was used. It was the product she worked on several years ago, Transplant Hero \u2014 an app that ensures that people who have a transplant organ stick to the rigorous meditation intake schedule. With the need for patients to take fifteen different medication four times a day \u2014 day and night \u2014 the project was incredibly challenging. It was the test for all the aspect of the field of UX, from user experience research and strategy to metrics and principles. More so, the user experience metrics the team she worked with gathered were not exactly re-affirming: among the 4 billion prescription given to patients worldwide, only half are taken correctly. To add to that, 15% of transplant patients have lost their lives because they forgot to take the medication on time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did Anna and the designer team face the towering challenge? First and foremost, the performed a rigorous research. The team used the following user experience research methods in the process of creating Transplant Hero:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User experience surveys carried out face to face with patients<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Observations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Design workshops<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the research and creation of a user experience strategy, the team decided that app should perform three key functions: <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remind about taking medication at the right time \u2014 the app should provide smart guidance<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be a game \u2014 the app should be a friend, not a doctor<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leverage positive aspects of social media, in a user experience design that excludes drama.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a series of discussions, the team outlined how this will work in detail, widening the scope of each function. Eventually the app\u2019s functions were expanded to the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Educate and become a friendly companion<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set achievable goals to build confidence and skills in users<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Celebrate progress and success<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Show value early on<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leverage social media influence for positivity<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, Anna and the team weaved a common thread between all the functions \u2014 friendly, cartoon-like characters, each of whom represented a human organ or a medication. The characters were key to user experience, the design in general, and helped Transplant Hero achieve its goals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5168\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-1024x589-1.jpg\" alt=\"UXPA Conference 2018\" width=\"704\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-1024x589-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-300x173-1.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-768x442-1.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-600x345-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-450x259-1.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-1000x575-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Presenation-Beginning.jpg 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Anna gives the main talk. On the screen to the right is the heart character from Transplant Hero, a mobile aid for transplant patients that she helped create.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPositive\u201d and \u201clight-hearted\u201d were common words in the team\u2019s discussions. In the end, the app served one more key purpose besides from ensuring transplant patients take their medication: take as much stress as possible from taking medication and post-transplantation process. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The app proved impactful. According to studies that were carried out in Montefiore Medical Center (where the app was used), Transplant hero doubled the medication adherence rate among patients who used it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along the way, Anna also shared examples of other works, including an app that helps to quit smoking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, Anna\u2019s talk described how a relatively simple behavioral model, a comprehensive user experience research, and spot-on creative choices born in the process of team collaboration, among other things, can help designers face challenges in arguably the most demanding industries, which also has the highest stakes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anna\u2019s second appearance at UXPA was in form of a poster talk, which was dedicated solely to the Transplant Hero project. It was a shorter version of the mobile solution\u2019s case study for those who missed the talk or hadn\u2019t had a lot of time on their hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5169\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Poster.jpg\" alt=\"uxpa international\" width=\"501\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Poster.jpg 835w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Poster-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Poster-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Poster-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Anna-Poster-450x337.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Anna answers the questions about Transplant Hero in the process of the poster talk.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In both cases, the reception was warm. The attendees thanked Anna for bringing up important questions, asked an abundance of questions after the main and poster talk, wanted to know more details, and voiced their excitement about the project. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final Thoughts \u2014 Looking Back at UXPA 2018<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the scale and the apparent seriousness, the User Experience Association has managed to preserve the togetherness and friendliness commonly associated with small conferences, while also managing to grow and scale. Recalling her days at UXPA 2018, Anna said she was amazed to learn that some people attended it for ten years straight or more. The fact that hundreds of designers and design researchers anticipate it like the next comic movie was equally inspiring. Over the years, UXPA has managed to preserve its reputation \u2014 an event that gathers open-minded and friendly people who would eagerly share their experience with each other, who believe that design is highly important, and highly impactful when approached comprehensively. All for making better products for a better world, while becoming better themselves. What\u2019s more amusing is that this locomotive of a UX conference doesn\u2019t show any signs of stopping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Learn more about our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/ui-ux-design-services\">UI and UX design services<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>See how our software solutions helped\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/cases\">Eurostar, EY, and other well-known companies<\/a>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Read the report about UXPA 2018, and how our designer Anna Iurchenko earned the chance to give 2 talks at the legendary conference. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":63,"featured_media":5164,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"User Experience Professionals Association continues to elevate its UX conference.
