Yet, you cannot directly attribute the success of any business to the mere existence of an app. It is also important how that app is designed, that is the user experience and user interface, as well as whether they carry over the company\u2019s brand to mobile well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, if you want to have a thriving online business where mobile plays a key part, you must first make sure your app has a fitting design that works for your customers. The more visually appealing and user-friendly it is, the greater the chances of attracting more loyal customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solid app design needs solid investment. This article will guide you through the factors that will determine the cost of your app, and help you understand what exactly you will be paying for and how much.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Factors Determining The Overall <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">App Design Cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quick app design cost search can reveal big numbers. However, you should not forget that design is the foundation of any product, not just mobile applications. Therefore, if you want users to love your app and continuously return to it, that numbers should not be all that surprising.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before moving on to finalizing your budget for app design, you must first understand how the entire process works. This will not only help you in calculating an approximate <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost for app design<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of your application, but also give you an idea of how your money would be put to use.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s quickly go through stages of mobile application design.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Conducting Market Research<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-17105\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Market-Research-For-The-Overall-App-Design-Cost.jpg\" alt=\"Market Research For The Overall App Design Cost\" width=\"331\" height=\"331\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Market-Research-For-The-Overall-App-Design-Cost.jpg 566w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Market-Research-For-The-Overall-App-Design-Cost-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Market-Research-For-The-Overall-App-Design-Cost-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Market-Research-For-The-Overall-App-Design-Cost-450x450.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Designing an application is not only about creativity. When you are launching an app, you naturally aim to acquire many users, gain popularity in the target market quickly, and make your business profitable both in the short and long term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To achieve this goal, you need to carry out comprehensive market research. Pinpointing the fitting target market, rival brands and products, and design features offered by other apps in the target market are just some of the many things you must know prior to designing your app. Here, you will already need a professional designer on your team: if researchers and the designer work separately, you will spend more time on this stage and risk the consistency of the design.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It generally takes around 20-40 hours of work to conduct a comprehensive research and come up with first actionable ideas. Feel free to extend that time frame to allow for more thinking space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of this stage, you will also learn an approximate <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your planned venture.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Designing UX \u2013 Wireframing\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to designing mobile applications, you cannot just rely on creativity and technical resources. You should also make your app a user-friendly, it is a topmost priority. An application that loads quickly, is easy to navigate, has all the options easily accessible, and is eye-pleasing is what users want. Besides, your app will gain more attention if it succeeds in giving a personalized experience to each user.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, you need to focus on creating a compelling UX design.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17106\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Designing-UX-User-Experience-\u2013-Wireframing-For-App-Design-Cost-.jpg\" alt=\"Designing UX (User Experience) \u2013 Wireframing For App Design Cost\" width=\"512\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Designing-UX-User-Experience-\u2013-Wireframing-For-App-Design-Cost-.jpg 512w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Designing-UX-User-Experience-\u2013-Wireframing-For-App-Design-Cost--300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Designing-UX-User-Experience-\u2013-Wireframing-For-App-Design-Cost--450x299.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Designing a good UX does not mean coming up with out-of-this-world features. For example, minimalistic design is often the best way to go. Remember, UX is all about user experience, literally. So, the ultimate goal is building an app that will appeal to your users. That is where the skills of a designer come into play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the product\u2019s nature, the features you want in your app, and the rival applications, it generally takes from around twenty to two hundred hours to create a winning UX design. The more effort your designer puts into working on the UX, the greater the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Working On The UI \u2013 Prototyping<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After UX design, the next step is designing a user interface, or UI, for your application. This phase includes adding stylistic elements to wireframes and app sketches to create a prototype of the app. You can then collaborate with your designer on any further changes to design to make the app user-friendly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-17107\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Working-On-The-UI-\u2013-Prototyping-For-App-Design-Cost.jpg\" alt=\"Working On The UI \u2013 Prototyping For App Design Cost\" width=\"572\" height=\"366\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Working-On-The-UI-\u2013-Prototyping-For-App-Design-Cost.jpg 793w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Working-On-The-UI-\u2013-Prototyping-For-App-Design-Cost-300x192.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Working-On-The-UI-\u2013-Prototyping-For-App-Design-Cost-768x491.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Working-On-The-UI-\u2013-Prototyping-For-App-Design-Cost-600x384.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Working-On-The-UI-\u2013-Prototyping-For-App-Design-Cost-450x288.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prototype of your app will give you a pretty good idea about the look and feel of your application. Any changes to the prototype can also influence the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost to design app<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as planned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Designers usually need about eight hours to deliver a prototype, including app sketches and wireframes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this stage, the designer checks how the features work in the app, and whether or not the app design can meet user expectations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Creating The Final Visual Design<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After finalizing the prototype, you can now confidently proceed to creating the final visual design. This stage is where a designer deploys all of their creativity to come up with a visually appealing mobile application for users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From color schemes to icons, logos, and images, every detail is added to the app on this stage. Then, the overall design is analyzed to see if all screens and sections work well together and deliver the right message to the application\u2019s end-user. This phase involves the use of the research done earlier to make the app more user-friendly and more attractive than those of rival companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This stage may take up eighty to two hundred hours, depending on the complexity of the app design. In turn, it impacts the final <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost to design an app<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. App Maintenance<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the launch of the app, begins a seemingly never-ending phase of maintenance. At times, you need to make changes to the application design based on customer feedback or to surpass competing applications. This will have a notable impact on your planned app design budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Features Increasing The Overall <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">App Design Price<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The common process of designing mobile applications remains almost the same for all apps. However, the more input an app requires from designers, the higher the cost for design.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional features such as illustrations and animations usually add to the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Illustrations:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These are rich visual presentations that reflect your company\u2019s brand and the app functionality. Based on the nature of the illustration you want (flat or 3D), a designer may require up to 32 hours to create it. Illustrations depicting human characters are more complex and need more time to complete, adding more to the designing price.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Animations:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Designing dynamic objects or images (such as GIFs) also requires more time and resources. While you can make your app more appealing by adding custom transitions and illustrated animations, be ready to add to your app cost as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Much Does App Design Cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In General?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from feature design, the price of creating an application also depends on the overall app complexity. Factors like additional visuals and support for multiple operating systems make the designing process more complex, thereby increasing its cost. That is why one cannot generalize a certain price for app design.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17108\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-Much-Does-App-Design-Cost-In-General-.jpg\" alt=\"How Much Does App Design Cost In General\" width=\"512\" height=\"361\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-Much-Does-App-Design-Cost-In-General-.jpg 512w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-Much-Does-App-Design-Cost-In-General--300x212.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-Much-Does-App-Design-Cost-In-General--450x317.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, considering the price range for designing an application of a certain complexity level, you can estimate your own <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For better understanding, we can sort mobile applications into three different complexity categories.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Simple Apps<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simple mobile applications are those that require minimum efforts, at least, from a designer\u2019s point of view. Such apps have a modest design, fewer animations, and are usually developed for one platform only.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SurfClub<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a simple yet interactive application for users. The app specifically aims at the surfers, features a simple design, and supports iOS only.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"SurfClub - Mobile App For Surfers\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TivNGmR5Wgk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The design of simple applications like SurfClub usually takes up around hundred hours, and the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> usually starts at $5000.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.\u00a0 Medium-level Complexity Applications<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of apps requires more effort from designers owing to the number of features they usually offer. Those involving illustrations, animations, and multiple features require designing numerous screens. Such apps may take up around two hundred to two hundred and fifty hours to design and may cost you roughly $10,000 on average.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Status<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an iOS-based social networking app, is a nice example of a medium-level complexity application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Status - Social Networking App\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nkdCiAlI650?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.\u00a0Complex Apps\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While most mobile applications usually fall under simple or medium-level complexity categories, there are also many complex applications out there. Such apps offer a wide variety of different features, may include custom illustrations and animations, and are usually designed for more than one platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tablet app for train staff of railway operator Eurostar is an example. The staff has many useful features on their hands, including reservation management, streamlined reporting, and staff chat, as well as a notification system that allows them to quickly respond to emergencies, and even book taxis for customers. The app also allows the company\u2019s managers to track and gather data to create comprehensive end-of-journey reports. Importantly, the solution allows managers to easily track and gather the data required to generate end-of-journey reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Eurostar - Train App\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rpiN5Tdk8jQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for complex apps may start at $20,000 go up to 250,000 and sometimes even reach bigger numbers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile Games<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-17109\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Complex-Apps-Design-Cost-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Complex Apps Design Cost\" width=\"658\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Complex-Apps-Design-Cost-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Complex-Apps-Design-Cost-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Complex-Apps-Design-Cost-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Complex-Apps-Design-Cost-600x338.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Complex-Apps-Design-Cost-450x253.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Complex-Apps-Design-Cost-1000x563.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Complex-Apps-Design-Cost.jpg 1260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile gaming applications are never simple, as even the very basic game apps involve animations and require a lot of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, depending on the complexity, designing game applications will at least cost you around $15,000 or more and involves at least 300 hours of work.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost Of Designing An App<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Based On Choice Of Platform<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rates for designing apps also vary for different platforms.

However, the critical thing with such apps is to take care of the App Store guidelines. Even slight negligence can lead to rejection of your app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is why iOS app design is usually expensive, with starting prices ranging between $500 and $10,000. Given, the price for your iOS app may go further up \u2014 it all depends on your requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UI Design For an Android App\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Designing Android apps is a far more complex process compared to app design for iOS. Hence, there exist significant variations in the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost to design an app<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Android.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is partly attributed to its high fragmentation. Different smartphone makers operate their devices on different versions of the OS with corresponding third-party elements. Moreover, devices running Android OS also vary greatly in what their hardware is capable of. Therefore, designing an app to make it compatible with such a huge number of varying devices requires a lot of input from designers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you merely focus on the latest Android devices with minimal app requirements, you can reduce the overall design cost by up to 10-15%.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Variations In <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost To Design An App<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> By Country<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, designers from developing countries tend to charge less as compared to the ones in developed economies.
