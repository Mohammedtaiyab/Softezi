Coupled with cloud and other technologies, IoT connects devices big and small to transform products, operations, and entire businesses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does it happen? We selected IoT software development examples of different scale from our own projects to show the impact of IoT in detail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s see how a luxury hotel chain, vending machine provider, and retail solutions company added the prefix \u201csmart\u201d to their businesses. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Types of IoT Software Development Services &amp; Solutions<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before exploring the cases, let\u2019s stop at the types of IoT software development and solutions for valuable context. They range in scale, complexity, and enabling hardware. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b> Embedded software development<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> involves creating software that would control other machines or devices. Examples of embedded software development applications include smart hotel systems where guests can use a tablet to control room amenities; next-generation vending machines with tables; interactive displays; and smart car systems. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b> Firmware development for Android<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. IoT development solutions like a smart room tablet, vending machine, or interactive display need their own Android firmware. This allows for building a custom launcher, connecting external sensors needed for a given solution, enforcing custom security policies, porting the latest Android OS, and enabling over-the-air updates and device monitoring.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b> Indoor &amp; outdoor navigation systems<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> primarily involve <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/what-are-beacons-and-how-do-they-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beacon technology<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and mobile devices. Beacons are small devices that send messages via Bluetooth to mobile devices, providing navigation, contextual experiences (for example information about a location an individual just entered), as well as ads and critical notifications. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b> Industrial IoT solutions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This solutions allow enterprises monitor operations with sensors to gather various types of data, inform about inconsistencies and emergencies, and get a wholesome view of operations. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b> Enterprise IoT solutions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> combine different types of IoT software development and hardware in scalable IoT ecosystems. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b> Custom IoT solutions <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solutions built from scratch for specific purposes or as a product. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><b>Enterprise IoT Solution \u2014 Smart Hotel System<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their first experience of outsourcing software development, an award-winning Asian hotel chain turned to Intellectsoft for a smart hotel system for its new, ambitious luxury hotel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The system would have a tablet app that allows guests to control amenities, access resort information, and drive sales. The project involved embedded software development and Android custom firmware development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Challenge<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The company\u2019s new hotel offers a range of suites of different size, from multi-bedroom suites to two-story villas. Each of them has a different set of amenities. We needed to create a universal tablet experience that would adapt to suite type and extend the chain\u2019s unmatched hotel experience to the tablet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Solution<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Our team created an Android app with pre-set designs for each suite type. In eye-pleasing and uncluttered UX, guests can control light, air conditioning, windows, TV, and media devices in all rooms. They also can use the app to order guest services, chat with stuff, receive notifications, and access important information (restaurant and in-room menus, entertainment, flight schedules, and other). \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-15215\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1.png\" alt=\"Internet of Things Development\" width=\"745\" height=\"559\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1.png 812w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1-600x450.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1-450x338.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\" \/><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Impact.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Regardless of scale, successful IoT development requires the right expertise and effort. After working closely with the client on and off site, our smart hotel solution ensured a smooth opening day for the client\u2019s one-of-the-kind resort and became essential to the hotel experience. Our partnership continues in Internet of Things development (beacon technology) as well as extending to solutions with other tech. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Android Custom Firmware Development &amp; Embedded Software Development \u2014 Smart Fridges<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it is a scalable Industrial IoT ecosystem or a solution of a much smaller scale, Internet of Things development often provides a foundation for a business. Our solution for Californian vending machine provider is a handy illustration of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Challenge<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The company provides offices around the U.S. with healthy food from local brands in smart fridges. Aiming to make the user experience as simple as possible, the company approached Intellectsoft to elevate the existing solution further up. The new solution also needed to have smooth integration with card readers and RFID antennas. In other words, the company\u2019s smart fridges needed to be a perfect example of what a frictionless user experience is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Solution<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Our designer team put together a questionnaire, dived deep on the subject of vending machines and how they work, and explored cases when tablets were used with hardware in the client\u2019s niche and similar markets. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our team\u2019s work resulted in Android tablet solution with unique, three-step UX: a user chooses a food item, swipes their card, and takes the item out of the fridge \u2014 as simple as that. The software engineers on the team ensured the simplicity and speed by establishing fail-safe <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">communication between the system, the card readers, and the RFID tags. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-15216\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"IoT software development\" width=\"583\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-600x600.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-450x450.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-1000x1000.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Smart-Fridge-Tablet.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To speed up the UX further, the solution involved no third-party software onboard. As embedded system software development allows for remote monitoring and over-the-air updates, the company could always manage their fleet of fridges and ensure the tablets are consistently updated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Impact<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Over the years, the result of our Internet of Things development continues to be a reliable foundation for the company\u2019s business. Our partnership continues to this day. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Indoor Positioning System with Android App &amp; Embedded Software Development<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As beacons started emerging several years ago, the retail industry was first in the queue to implement them. Hidden from plain sight, these small, cost-effective devices were set to help retailers breath new life into the in-store experience along with mobile apps. Right at that moment, a company specializing in IT solutions for retail got in touch with Intellectsoft for an indoor positioning system and Internet of Things software development. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Challenge<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The solution needed to locate the user on premises and supply them with promotional information. The GPS option was excluded. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Solution<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As Beacons rely on Bluetooth technology, the devices were the perfect fit for the project. We designed an indoor positioning system were beacons are strategically placed to accommodate the user experience and drive sales. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-15217\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1159797838.jpg\" alt=\"Embedded software development\" width=\"553\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1159797838.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1159797838-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1159797838-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1159797838-600x401.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_1159797838-450x301.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make everything work, we added a mobile app to the equation. Our IoT software development efforts result in an Android app that allows users create and modify shopping lists with details about the products they are interested in, like name barcode or product category. While creating a list, they can take advantage of prior history, auto-suggestions, loyalty cards, product searches, and favorites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, beacons and app pairing can be used to send location-based individual offers to shoppers: when a user approaches an item they could be interested in, a beacon sends a notification to the app. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Impact<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As beacons were only emerging back then, our solution gave the company and their clients an edge over competition. The beacon-based indoor positioning system supplied customers with individual notifications, opening up new marketing avenues for retailers, driving sales, and adding value to both customer and in-store experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Final Notes<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the scale and type of solution, Internet of Things software development can become a solid foundation for a business or a separate operation. Coupled with mobile and other technologies, IoT allows companies to solve existing issues, deliver new experiences, and continuously drive sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From industrial IoT applications to custom products with Internet of Things at their very core, Intellectsoft will continue examining the cases with technology in upcoming posts. <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Intellectsoft\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow us on Facebook<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to stay informed. \u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Need an impactful and reliable IoT solution? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/contacts\">Get in touch with us<\/a>. <\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We explore examples in hospitality, retail, and custom solutions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":63,"featured_media":15218,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[797],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Whether it is embedded software development or industrial IoT, Internet of Things development makes a big impact on any business.
