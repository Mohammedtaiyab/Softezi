And while business messenger Slack dominated the chatbot revolution, everybody was waiting for Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook to show up with their chatbot platform. So we\u2019ve been waiting patiently and the miracle finally happened at F8 conference triggering the chatbot boom, which is still continuing today.<\/p>\n<p>Now you may wonder when this craze is going to die down. It&#8217;s hard to say, but what we know so far is that they&#8217;re here to stay and they&#8217;re going to keep on revolutionizing.<\/p>\n<p>But wait, Bogdan, what\u2019s the big deal about chatbots and why is everybody talking about them?! It&#8217;s all about capturing user attention, which nowadays is focused heavily on messenger apps. Furthermore, bots are using Natural Language Processing algorithms and AI layer to communicate with you, messaging apps are the best place for them to live. Let\u2019s try to figure out why.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine you\u2019re a media company like The Wall Street Journal, Business Insider or CNN. You\u2019re making revenue by selling advertising and publishing sponsored content, while your main expenses are creating and distributing content. So let\u2019s think a bit about distribution.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The open rate for mobile messages is a near perfect 98 percent, which is exponentially higher than the 22 percent rate emails employ.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scripted.com\/content-marketing-2\/chatbot-marketing\">Scripted<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Soon we&#8217;ll start seeing chatbots everywhere.

Most of them have less than 10 people working for a company, but they\u2019re obligated to hire an extra person just for answering online enquiries from customers.

Here\u2019s a list of business models that would benefit from the application of chatbots.<\/p>\n<h3>Pure retail sales bots<\/h3>\n<p>Retail is one of the most straightforward experiences you will find amongst chatbots. You can imagine stores like Wal-Mart, Harry\u2019s, Target and Amazon creating bots where people can ask them if they sell something like \u201cShampoo\u201d or \u201cHammer\u201d and the bot responds with prices and a \u201cBuy now\u201d button. Take Amazon\u2019s Alexa for example: right now you can ask Alexa to re-order the goods you bought last week on Amazon! The user will make the purchase directly through a chat with the bot and it will act in a similar way to a transaction from a typical website, but it will be done in the palm of their hand.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We are able to learn quickly from the orders history, so we can turn the bot into a productivity bot. Based on the individual user shopping habits the bot is able to predict what the user would buy, so the cart will already be prefilled with products the bot will pick.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Cloderic Mars, CTO @ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.craft.ai\/\">craft.ai<\/a><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Bots + sponsored &amp; native content<\/h3>\n<p>Native content and advertising is a trend that has been soaring over the past few years thanks to the likes of BuzzFeed, VICE, Huffington Post, Business Insider and more. Native or Sponsored content is a model in which brands pay to have their content distributed by media companies directly into their channels in a way that is often viewed as content created by the media outlet rather than a brand.<\/p>\n<p>Now imagine you\u2019re using a Cooking Bot. While the bot will tell you that swapping Cumin for Coriander is okay in a certain recipe through its native function , it will also send you an article that talks about \u201c5 Exotic Meat Recipes That Will Please Your Guests.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Bots for research<\/h3>\n<p>Wondering what millennials are thinking about the Presidential Election?<\/p>\n<p>There are bots that you can pay to do the research for you. Bots like <a href=\"https:\/\/botlist.co\/bots\/639-disordatbot\">DisOrDatBot<\/a> are already asking people simple this or that questions, as you can see in the example above.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_13972\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-13972\" style=\"width: 485px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-13972\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/DisorDatBot-research-poll-chat-bot.jpg\" alt=\"DisorDatBot research poll chat bot\" width=\"485\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/DisorDatBot-research-poll-chat-bot.jpg 485w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/DisorDatBot-research-poll-chat-bot-300x179-1.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/DisorDatBot-research-poll-chat-bot-450x268-1.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-13972\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">DisorDatBot chat bot interface<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Now, imagine you\u2019re an event planner and are trying to determine which music act you should try to book for your city. Rather than using an expensive research firm or inaccurate focus group, you can run a research campaign with DisOrDatBot and ask users in your city whether they prefer Radiohead or Nickelback.<\/p>\n<h3>Bots for lead generation<\/h3>\n<p>Lead generation businesses are like the Wild West of the online world.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a landing page.<\/li>\n<li>Acquire targeted leads.<\/li>\n<li>Sell leads to producers.<\/li>\n<li>Profit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the near future we will see chatbots that act as lead generation businesses with an initial focus on content. The chatbots will deliver insights and information to users who are looking for advice about home ownership, insurance, weddings or finances and then pass along user information to various businesses who sell services and products that line up with the content they\u2019re delivering.<\/p>\n<p>For example, imagine you\u2019re talking to the \u201cShopping Bot\u201d and start engaging in a conversation about home buying. As the discussion continues, the bot gathers information like the amount of cash you have for a down payment, where you want to live, whether you\u2019re employed and whether it\u2019s your first home. After building this relationship, the bot asks you:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Could I pass this along to someone to get in touch?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You agree and the bot then passes your information along to a Real Estate company in your area. The Real Estate company follows up with you the next day and the bot company gets paid for the lead.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the greatest added values of chatbots is using them for generating prospects. You can reach your potential clients directly where their attention is (messengers) and present them your newest products, services or goods. When a customer would like to purchase a product\/service, he\/she can make the purchase within the chatbot, including the payment process. Bots, like 1-800flowers.com, eBay, Fynd have already proved that.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Julien Blancher, Co-Founder @ <a href=\"https:\/\/recast.ai\/\">Recast.AI<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s the updated lead generation process, but using a bot:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Company Creates Lead Generation Bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bot Validates The Lead.<\/li>\n<li>Lead Passed To Company.<\/li>\n<li>Commision Paid By Company To Bot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Cost per conversation\/task<\/h3>\n<p>People want advice and are always willing to pay for it.<\/p>\n<p>As bots become more sophisticated, I expect people will be willing to pay to have conversations with the bots that can help them with miscellaneous challenges in life. For example, you could talk to the \u201cOprah Bot\u201d if you needed life advice, the \u201cMechanic Bot\u201d for information on your car or the \u201cMarriage Bot\u201d if you wanted anonymous marriage counseling.<\/p>\n<p>Marriage counselors can charge anywhere from $75 to $200 or more per hour depending on where you live, the experience of the therapist, and the type of setting.<\/p>\n<p class=\"upgrades\"><strong>Ready to build a conversational bot for your business?<\/strong>\u00a0We&#8217;ve already made successful bots for media companies and e-commerce businesses.
