The event took place on 18-19 of April and gathered blockchain development and consultancy companies, developers, and technology enthusiasts from all over the world to network, discuss the technology, and find partnerships at London\u2019s Olympia. While <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cryptocurrency<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> remained a major topic, the expo served as a platform for fruitful discussions and sharing of real-life blockchain technology use cases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intellectsoft took a pivotal part in the expo. It was the first event our recently announced <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blockchain.intellectsoft.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain Lab<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> took part in, and the first time we shared our massive blockchain project in detail \u2014 our Board Director Michael Minkevich delivered the keynote. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nick Kurat, Director of the Lab, answered questions and discussed all things blockchain with the attendees, sharing the expertise from the impactful <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/solutions\/blockchain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain solutions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we delivered over the last two years. Joining him was Tim Kozak, Head of Technology at the Lab, who also delivered a talk about the history of blockchain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the event had many highlights, from extensive blockchain solution showcase from Porsche \u2014 to numerous compelling panels that discussed blockchain implementation across industries. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read the story of the two-day expo in our post-event coverage.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Day 1 \u2014 The History of Blockchain Unfolding Before Us<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though a lot of people consider that blockchain is still in its young years, the progress the technology has made since 2015 is nothing but astonishing. From recounting the history to numerous use cases to panels that were rooted in reality, Day 1 of Blockchain Expo put the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cryptocurrency<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> talk aside to show how much has been achieved in the blockchain world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4881\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Expo-Intro.jpg\" alt=\"blockchain conference\" width=\"711\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Expo-Intro.jpg 960w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Expo-Intro-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Expo-Intro-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Expo-Intro-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Expo-Intro-450x338.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the main aim of the keynote by Tim Kozak, Head of Technology at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blockchain.intellectsoft.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intellectsoft Blockchain Lab<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. His \u201cWitnessing the Evolution of Blockchain\u201d keynote speech brought to attention a number of facts that are easily lost in the overwhelming blockchain hype: bitcoin was only worth $220 in 2015, and that it has been only three years since Ethereum, Hyperledger, R3 consortium, and Lightning Network have seen the light of the digital day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim also stated that the last three years were immensely challenging for blockchain as a technology. First, it has prompted a massive technological shift in a rapidly changing environment. Second, educational info, documentation, tools, and blockchain specialists were scarce. Nevertheless, in less than three years, the world has seen the first <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain technology uses cases<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These were not small scale projects: companies like EY, Maersk, and Comcast have already used the immense <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/big-enterprises-use-blockchain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits of blockchain technology<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, coming in conjoint usage of smart contract code and IoT in a single, meticulously developed software platform. Terms like \u201csidechain\u201d will not leave the territory of the blockchain world anytime soon, but other, for example DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology), are becoming increasingly common. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4888\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"blockchain conference 2018\" width=\"667\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-450x338.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-1000x750.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim also mentioned that governments and businesses around the world gradually grapple with the first wave of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/blockchain-government-regulation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain laws<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He also stated that there are significantly more opportunities for blockchain-related education and talent development today than it was half a year ago. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the fact that blockchain is quickly going from oddity to basic technology was also emphasised by the blockchain expo itself, with an enormous number of attendees from different countries and industries gathering to network and discuss how the technology will reshape the enterprise, and the world. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kozak\u2019s keynote was partly based on the book he co-wrote. It covers the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">history of blockchain technology<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cryptocurrency<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, existing <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (including the Estonian blockchain based governmental services), as well as the future of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain solutions for business<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

She shared Garage\u2019s first projects early on, establishing that the expo will be more about blockchain\u2019s high potential than confounding hype. Lowry urged to dream big with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain technology solutions,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and use them to change the future; to always consider business value at the start of a blockchain project; and to approach blockchain like a team sport, that is to actively make connections. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Blockchain Expo Provides Concrete Cases<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event continued with an extensive keynote on the food supply chain of the future from Vincent Doumeizel, Vice President Food &amp; Sustainability, Lloyd&#8217;s Register. The keynote made it evident that the promise of<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blockchain solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help the humanity face the future challenges in the food industry (population growth, food fraud, and other) as well as address key customer demands \u2014 healthy food, fair trade, animal welfare, social responsibility, food security. What is more, a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain platform<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would protect the food system from bioterrorism. Making a solid case, Vincent Doumeizel argued that the current blockchain hype should be followed by the hope that emerging technologies can make the world a better place \u2014 citing positive statistics on how significantly the poverty level has dropped in the last two hundred years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in the day, Yan Li, CEO, GXS Foundation Ltd, delivered a compelling talk on building data economy ecosystems that give the users full control of their data and its monetization. Such a system relies on three cornerstone components \u2014 users, a mobile application (more specifically a decentralized application, or DApp), and a data exchange platform. According to Li, a well-built <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain platform<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with these underlying elements will allow to address current key challenges: invasion of privacy, no incentive scheme for a data owner to share their data, no copyright protection. Finally, Yan Li shared two <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain development solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from China, one of which is a blockchain city in a decentralized blockchain app, on its own <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain platform<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another impressive keynote came from Porsche. The legendary vehicle-maker <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/how-brands-use-augmented-reality-in-manufacturing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has been embracing the latest tech<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> decisively and profusely, including blockchain. The company has been developing a blockchain ecosystem with vehicles and user privacy at its heart. Porsche aims to establish a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain solution<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), tokens, and Ethereum-based smart contracts \u2014 to elevate the smart car concept to the the highest point possible. Apart from the high level of privacy offered by <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Porsche drivers will enjoy easier access to car services, control over their data, and over the car in general. For example, Porsche\u2019s blockchain solution will allow drivers to give access to their trunk, so that a delivery service employee can put the parcel into it; share their car on blockchain with friends, colleagues, and family members; charge the car; and other. Although the project is in early stages, the scale is ambitious; it seems Porsche is concrete about using the potential of blockchain to the fullest. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Towards the end of Day 1, there also was a lively discussion on the \u201cBlockchain in the Healthcare System\u201d panel. Moderated by Tina Woods from Collider Health, and with Stewart Southey from NHS, the participants discussed moving patient data within the blockchain, the importance of patient privacy and security in data sharing, as well as automated patient consent. The healthcare industry will be among the first to reap immense <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits of blockchain technology<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4887\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Nick-Kurat-Talks-to-Attendees-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"blockchain expo\" width=\"643\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Nick-Kurat-Talks-to-Attendees-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Nick-Kurat-Talks-to-Attendees-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Nick-Kurat-Talks-to-Attendees-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Nick-Kurat-Talks-to-Attendees-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Nick-Kurat-Talks-to-Attendees-450x338.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Nick-Kurat-Talks-to-Attendees-1000x750.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Nick Kurat (left) answers the questions of our booth&#8217;s guests<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going back to Intellectsoft, our leading experts had been answering questions all day long.

The experts started off with discussing the general applications of blockchain in manufacturing. They got to details quickly, conversing about how the technology could help in supply chain visibility, anti-counterfeiting, and airworthiness certificate tracking. The experts also brought to attention the higher level of efficiency and better cost optimisation with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain as a platform<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in general, concluding with thoughts on how the technology will influence the future of the industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next panel was dedicated to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain solutions for business<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the property market. Experts from Juniper Research and The Bitfury Group set forth how blockchain can be used to follow the entire transaction history of property, and the benefits of the technology in this case. As the panel continued, it quickly became clear that blockchain is the means that will significantly elevate the property industry. This includes immediate transactions with smart contracts from anywhere in the world, reduced fraud risks, more secure digital databases and identifications \u2014 the industry could leverage all the tools offered by the technology, in one platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4855\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US.jpg\" alt=\"Blockchain Regulation\" width=\"640\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US-300x240.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US-768x614.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US-600x480.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US-450x360.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Day 2 also raised the crucial question of current blockchain regulation. A panel of experts discussed the development of standards for interoperable <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain technology solutions;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> whether regulations need to adjust the classification of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cryptocurrencies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and address taxation, money laundering and security; examined the challenges of deploying <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain solutions for business<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To briefly sum it up, the majority of countries want to heavily regulate cryptocurrency, but not the blockchain technology. You can also read our extensive summary on the current state of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/blockchain-government-regulation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain regulation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing on the subject of blockchain and finance, \u00a0Oliver Volk, Allianz Blockchain Expert and Keynote Speaker at Allianz Re, moderated a panel dedicated to the insurance industry. The experts concluded that blockchain platforms can help drive innovation in insurance business by making it more effective in fraud detection, pricing, and lowering administrative costs; by improving customer engagement and allowing for more cost-efficient offerings on emerging markets; as well as by helping address the many trends of digitalisation in mature markets. The paired power of blockchain and IoT in one platform was also brought to attention of the attendees. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Taking Care of User Experience in Blockchain Solutions<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain Expo 2018<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was coming to a close, Chris Tse from Cardstack gave his \u201cHumanizing the Blockchain\u201d keynote, which primary dealt with the importance of UX in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain technology solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicating a separate keynote to the subject was essential. With strong hype, the speed with which blockchain technologies evolve, and the increasingly competitive blockchain market, it is important to remember that users come first. Tse argued that, in 2018, the best interfaces still needed improvement \u2014 to offer a consistent and cohesive experience, and deliver on the promise of control of digital living. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially important if the blockchain community really sees the technology as a massive force for change that would eventually reach mass adoption. In other words, when the talks about what <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cryptocurrencies to watch<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> come to an end and blockchain becomes part of our daily lives, the developers need to ensure that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain technologies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are almost as easy to use as current online stores, digital payments, or even coffee makers. Tse raised important questions: How can we design solid DApps and deliver on the promise of decentralization in full? What conceptual obstacles in users\u2019 minds developers need to overcome to built such an app? Could we go beyond even the most bold solutions discussed at any <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain technology conference<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Tse\u2019s talk proved to be exciting, gripping, and thought-provoking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4889\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"blockchain conference\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-450x338.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-1000x750.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain Expo 2018<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was coming to a close.
