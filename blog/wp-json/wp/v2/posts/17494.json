If you have a big project or plan to scale, it is better to delegate the hiring duties entirely to a trustworthy outsourcing partner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 1 \u2013 Select a company<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make a primary analysis, and then narrow down your list to 2-3 options. Select a company based on client reviews and what your partners\/associates have to say. Top managers usually have many connections and can easily acquire an informative overview on a range of potential IT partners.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 2 \u2013 Inquire about the chosen vendor<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the commencement of communication, it is important to find out as much as possible about your vendor. This includes inquiring about the vendor\u2019s how many years the vendor has been operating in the industry, pricing, procedure for candidate selection, skills, etc. If several vendors fit your initial requirements, find out the information regarding their services and prices and compare them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 3 \u2013 Provide enough project\/job details<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to provide as many details as possible regarding your project or position you need to fill. The more details, the better the outcome.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 4 \u2013 Set up a dedicated team structure<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have an approximate team structure for your project, discuss it with your partner. In reality, you may need more or less developers for your project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 5 \u2013 Familiarize with your recruiter<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the negotiation stage ends and you sign a contract with the chosen company, you get a recruiter for your project. To know that you and your recruiter are on the same page and can develop a long-term work relationship, you need to communicate your requirements\/preferences to them to get an effective result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 6 \u2013 Check your email frequently<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing that the Ukrainian IT market is growing fast, most of the candidates have numerous job offers to choose from. So, once you have contacted the recruiter, you need to check your emails regularly. The candidates\u2019 resumes or any questions asked by the recruiter may need to be reviewed\/answered as quickly as possible so that the candidate is not hired by any other organization before you make a decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 7 \u2013 Interview candidates<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enlisting an IT recruiting company has its own benefits. If you work with an IT outsourcing provider, you will have a recruiter assigned to your project. In any case, a recruiter arranges a fitting schedule for you and your candidates to conduct an interview. You can then determine the duration of the interviewing process, completion criteria, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 8 \u2013 Provide feedback<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Needless to say, both the recruiter and candidate expect to receive feedback from you. If anything goes wrong, the recruiter should know what needs to be adjusted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 9 \u2013 Recruit developers<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you make a decision, double-check whether a candidate fits the position but don\u2019t take too long as the candidate may accept the offer from another employer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 10 \u2013 Get started<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you hire the right candidate for your project, it is time to introduce him to the rest of the team.
