The top trends include:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are powerful tools for the insurance industry, the implementation of which can enhance services, make them faster, and create a better customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>Higher productivity of the services will result in reduced costs and increased revenue for the companies. These tech tools can tackle challenges connected with the insurance value chain, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">underwriting,<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">product pricing,<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fraud detection,<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loss prevention,<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claims handling,<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer experience,<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sales.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>ML is helpful with damage assessment and prediction of the repair costs based on the available data from similar cases. Global connectivity of people and devices, better computing power, big data technologies, memory capabilities are the reasons behind machines running complex algorithms faster.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the companies have already experienced the advantages of AI. For example, GetSafe, InsurTech startup, <a href=\"https:\/\/getsafe.pr.co\/173014-new-insurance-platform-creates-basis-for-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uses AI<\/a> to advise customers on which insurance policies to purchase by collecting relevant information. They have also developed a mobile app for the customers to manage all their insurance policies in one place.<\/p>\n<p>Another example of AI usage are chatbots that serve as virtual assistants of insurers for the customers (startups like Lincoln Financial, Geico, Lemonade).<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. IoT (Internet of Things)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Internet of Things or wearables is another tech trend in the insurance industry as these devices can transfer huge volumes of data. With real-time IoT data, insurers can provide real-time advice for drivers, on-the-spot health advice, immediate accident assistance, and even trigger claim payments.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, IoT will give companies a chance to rely on statistics when assessing risk and model potential risks. IoT also allows companies to have more frequent interaction with their customers and offer new services based on collected data that can result in stronger relationships and personalized offers.<\/p>\n<p>One of the examples of IoT-based services is Erie Insurance company that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.erieinsurance.com\/news-room\/press-releases\/2015\/drone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uses drones for property inspections<\/a> in the vent of a damage claim. It gives them a chance to get a better picture that results in better damage assessment. Also, there is no need for employees to travel to the location.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Blockchain\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the main benefits of blockchain technology in the insurance field is creating a secure register of information.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, customers who want to use online insurance services are required to provide tentative data. Blockchain solutions will help the insurers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to keep customers\u2019 data protected,<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to prevent unauthorized modifications, data addition, or removal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Customer privacy is a priority for companies who want to win loyalty and establish long-term relationships. Greater transparency for customers may boost their trust.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20734\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Insurance-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Blockchain Insurance\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Insurance-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Insurance-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Insurance-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Insurance-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Insurance-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Insurance-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Insurance-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Insurance-450x300.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blockchain-Insurance-1000x667.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Blockchain is a secure, reliable, and fast enabler to automate processes (e.g., smart contracts), offer microinsurance products and operate a decentralized organization. Services powered with blockchain solutions add quality value and result in revenue growth, improved customer experience, ability to offer new cost-effective products, and help IoT insurance product development.<\/p>\n<p>One of the real-life examples of blockchain usage is Etherisc. The company has built <a href=\"https:\/\/etherisc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a free, open-source, open-access platform for decentralized insurance<\/a>. The technology is used for fraud detection, it verifies claims based on the data from multiple data resources.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Mobile Applications\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mobile apps are powerful tools for any kind of business, and insurance is not an exception. It is a media for communication and interaction of the insurers with their partners and customers.<\/p>\n<p>Companies can also reach new customers via apps as nowadays people will choose to download an app and check the information, rather than search for the website of the company. Insurance apps can help with the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding detailed information about the company and its services.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checking and selecting suitable insurance packages.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying insurance packages online via an app without visiting the office.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting insurance policy costs calculated.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying in touch with the agent\/broker, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Mobile applications have benefits not only for the customers but also for the insurance agents. It will allow them to work with the documentation even on the move, keep records on the customers, write reports, etc.<\/p>\n<p>One of the examples is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.allstate.com\/support\/mobile-apps\/allstate-mobile.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Allstate Mobile<\/a>, it is a car insurance application that allows customers to perform a number of operations like paying bills, submitting claims, finding an agent, etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Big Data\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Big Data comprises data storage, reporting, and analytical tools. It can provide insights into customers\u2019 behavior and habits, allow companies to have efficient planning and reporting software.<\/p>\n<p>Big Data analytics will give carriers a chance to make risk predictions based on the behavioral patterns of the customers. The implementation of technology can also result in better claim management.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20736\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Insurance-Industry-Software-Trends-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Big Data Insurance\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1709\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Insurance-Industry-Software-Trends-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Insurance-Industry-Software-Trends-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Insurance-Industry-Software-Trends-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Insurance-Industry-Software-Trends-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Insurance-Industry-Software-Trends-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Insurance-Industry-Software-Trends-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Insurance-Industry-Software-Trends-600x401.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Insurance-Industry-Software-Trends-450x300.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Insurance-Industry-Software-Trends-1000x668.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It can be useful in a number of ways, for instance, car insurance companies can use Big Data analytics to create predictive modeling, identify whether the driver can be involved in the accident, and provide a personalized offer to the customer.<\/p>\n<h2>Insurance Software Solutions: The Best Vendors on the Market<\/h2>\n<p>Software insurance solutions are provided by a number of vendors who have managed to develop exclusive software for the insurers to enhance their services and customer loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>The key players of the industry are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vertafore.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Vertafore<\/i><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Vertafore is an insurance technology company that provides insurance agency software solutions to help them better manage their business and processes to grow revenue and be more profitable.
