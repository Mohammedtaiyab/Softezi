Net neutrality, as\u00a0you might be\u00a0wondering, is\u00a0a\u00a0term used to\u00a0describe the behavior of\u00a0Internet service providers (ISPs) as\u00a0concerns the way that they deliver data to\u00a0their clients. This also concerns something called \u201cvertical integration.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>To\u00a0steal a\u00a0glimmering example from the pages of\u00a0Jack Donaghy, imagine that, say, Frito Lay\u2014the crafter tasty snacks like Doritos and Cheetos\u2013was owned by\u00a0Proctor &amp; Gamble\u2014the powerhouse behind Pepto-Bismol. If\u00a0you can\u2019t see why that might be\u00a0bad, let me\u00a0spell it\u00a0out for you: they might be\u00a0tempted to\u00a0mix some laxative ingredients into their delicious crunchy snacks in\u00a0a\u00a0way to\u00a0boost Pepto-revenues. Get it? Vertical integration.<\/p>\n<p>This more or\u00a0less represents the reality of\u00a0net neutrality. The net neutrality rules were established by\u00a0the FCC back in\u00a02010 to\u00a0curb the efforts of\u00a0ISPs (Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon, etc.) from influencing the flow of\u00a0data by\u00a0blocking and slowing down particular sources. The net neutrality law forced these companies to\u00a0behave like a\u00a0utility in\u00a0that they could not show special preference to\u00a0any particular websites or\u00a0streams of\u00a0communication for any reason (provided it\u00a0was not harmful). All bandwidth had to\u00a0be\u00a0allocated equally\u2014as per government mandate.<\/p>\n<p>Since the original passing of\u00a0the net neutrality law, the goons at\u00a0Comcast and AT&amp;T have been pushing to\u00a0appeal\u00a0it. On\u00a0Tuesday January 14th, 2014, a\u00a0federal court ruled that these laws do\u00a0not apply to\u00a0ISPs as\u00a0they are not \u201ccommon carriers.\u201d How will this affect you? In\u00a0the worst way possible.<\/p>\n<p>You want to\u00a0use YouTube\u2014because it\u2019s free, and great, but suddenly it\u00a0takes forever to\u00a0buffer any of\u00a0the videos. But if\u00a0you use AT&amp;T\u2019s paid service, however, you get to\u00a0watch as\u00a0much as\u00a0you like and at\u00a0speeds as\u00a0fast you like. Do\u00a0you see what\u2019s happening? These companies, in\u00a0their perpetual chase of\u00a0the almighty greenback, will use dirty tactics like this to\u00a0squeeze every last penny out of\u00a0you, the consumer.<\/p>\n<p>As\u00a0of\u00a0Tuesday, companies can pick and choose from which websites they wish to\u00a0deliver data\u2014and they\u2019re going to\u00a0charge those websites for that privilege. That\u2019s going to\u00a0seriously hurt the number of\u00a0free websites, apps, and services that exist across the Web\u2014driving many to\u00a0bankruptcy and so\u00a0siphoning the power of\u00a0the American Internet from the control of\u00a0the people to\u00a0the control of\u00a0a\u00a0rich few\u2014whose only desire is\u00a0to\u00a0take more of\u00a0your money.<\/p>\n<p>The end results of\u00a0this fight are dubious at\u00a0best. My\u00a0prediction, however, stems from the adage that necessity is\u00a0the mother of\u00a0invention. I\u00a0believe that this action that is\u00a0rooted only in\u00a0greed will ultimately be\u00a0the bullet that shoots these companies in\u00a0their proverbial feet.<\/p>\n<p>Google is\u00a0breaking out its ultra-fast 1000mb\/s fiber networks, and they\u2019re a\u00a0good start to\u00a0shutting these fools down. However the idea is\u00a0to\u00a0keep the flow of\u00a0information in\u00a0the hands of\u00a0the people. People are going to\u00a0start working and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/technological-services\">developing and programming<\/a> like never before, designing and creating new ways to\u00a0free the Internet from the vice grips of\u00a0big business. I\u00a0don\u2019t yet know what they look like, but this outrage is\u00a0fueling a\u00a0fire that is\u00a0turning gears. The wheels are moving. Get involved.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Net neutrality, as you might be wondering, is a term used to describe the behavior of Internet service providers (ISPs) as concerns the way that they deliver data to their clients.
