The next step: shortening the list and pinpointing the best and most suitable partners for your software project.

Remember that many clients prefer their apps to be excluded from a software development company\u2019s portfolio (to stay ahead of competition in a definitive moment or as part of a non-disclosure agreement).<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>A noteworthy app portfolio should be coherent, descriptive, and to the point<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A noteworthy app portfolio should be coherent, descriptive, and to the point.

Separate solutions, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/design-lab\">UI\/UX design<\/a> for mobile apps, might exhibit a different delivery, displaying design concepts, schemes, and a description of the thinking behind the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portfolios that exhibit such characteristics will allow you to move on to the next step \u2014 getting in touch with the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software development company<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you are interested in and arranging a meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this stage, case studies should remain in the spotlight of your attention. Ask your potential <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app developers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to give you deeper insight into their projects. This will help you understand the depth of their expertise and decide whether they are a suitable partner for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Case studies should stay in the spotlight of your attention on the first meeting with your potential software development partner<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a solid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/\">software development company<\/a> will most certainly place their portfolio (or showcase clients with links to case studies) somewhere near the top of the Home page. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Finding A<\/b><b>pp Developers:\u00a0<\/b><b>The Latest Technologies<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/past-future-vr-ar\">Augmented and virtual reality<\/a>, artificial intelligence, beacons, and other technologies are being developed and deployed across multiple industries, changing the way they operate and cater to the needs of their clients. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As smartphones had become an inherent part of our lives, the change is aided by mobile. More and more apps are using AI-based chatbots; retail has embraced VR, AR, and beacons to deliver new, immersive, and emotional user experiences; and machine learning is slowly entering the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/ai-enterprise-software-companies-benefit-technology\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enterprise environment<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These technologies streamline business operations, help companies cut costs, and bring a wide array of other benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequently, you should look out for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/app-developers\">iOS and Android app developers<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0who have experience in creating software that uses at least one of the latest technologies. In the long-run, this will help you ensure that you are working with a partner who is capable of helping you keep up with the demands of your industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Finding App Developers: App Reviews<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you plan a deep, rigorous search, you should also consider \u201craw\u201d feedback from users of the developers\u2019 apps. Here, there are several things to keep in mind while reading reviews:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple\u2019s App Store resets reviews after every app update. You will not be able to see how users reacted to overhauls, bugs, and other changes. Very often, the comment section will have no comments at all. On the other hand, comments in the Apple App Store are to the point and usually not too emotion-driven compared to other app stores.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Play lets you see all app reviews \u2014 from the first version to the latest update. You can keep track of whether the Android <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app developers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have been listening to user requests, and monitor the quality and timeliness of updates. Expect pure feedback \u2014 many users on Google Play express their feeling about updates quite emotionally. Another thing to consider is that the majority of smartphone users in the world have Android devices with branded software on top, and satisfying the needs of each and every user is a challenge that takes a lot of time and effort. \u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessofapps.com\/how-to-choose-app-developer\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BusinessofApps<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> advised users to keep in mind the negativity bias: people leave reviews when they dislike something far more often than when they liked something. They also note the importance of numbers: 100 negative reviews don\u2019t make an app with 250 000 users a bad app.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Finding App Developers: Niche Specializations<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some industries \u2014 like healthcare and logistics \u2014 demand a complex and nuanced approach to software development. Thus, you should consider the experience your potential app developers have in your industry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a hospital can create a simple navigation and information app by using an app builder (without the help of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/mobile-app-development-services\">mobile <\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app developers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), but they will need to approach a custom software development company for hospital software, which, for example, digitises and automates operations. What\u2019s more, the company should know the particular regulations and rules that determine the functionality of a healthcare software solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Counting in passion as criteria is not immediately evident, but it could eventually define the success of your app.<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>\u00a0<b>Finding App Developers: Passion for Project<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/theyec\/2015\/08\/13\/3-steps-to-hire-the-right-app-developer-for-the-technology-disinclined\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#c1a1ba63d865\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> points out that passion for your project is another criteria that\u2019s not immediately evident, but could define the success of your software. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">App developers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are open-minded folk who like to read, travel, and indulge in various activities, so it is likely that they might be familiar with your industry.
