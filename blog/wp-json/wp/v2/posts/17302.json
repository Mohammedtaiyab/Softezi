In many cases, there is an overlap of time zones, culture, and languages between the client team and the nearshore team. This makes the communication significantly easier \u2014 an extremely important factor, as any software development project involves a lot of communication between all its participants. As a result, nearshore software development enables solid collaboration between the teams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-17304\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/nearshore-software-development-1024x325.png\" alt=\"nearshore software development\" width=\"1024\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/nearshore-software-development-1024x325.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/nearshore-software-development-300x95.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/nearshore-software-development-768x244.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/nearshore-software-development-600x191.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/nearshore-software-development-450x143.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/nearshore-software-development-1000x318.png 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/nearshore-software-development.png 1287w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Advantages And Disadvantages of Nearshore Outsourcing<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although nearshore outsourcing has become a top choice for companies across the world, it has its benefits and drawbacks like any other model.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Benefits of nearshore outsourcing<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearshoring has some big benefits that can help you finish your project successfully.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Geographical proximity. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is easier, quicker, and more cost-effective to have face-to-face meetings with the nearshoring team, as they are located in the nearby country.

As a result, they can collaborate, communicate, and solve issues more easily.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Time zone alignment<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Nearshoring is a shortcut to hiring experts with the right technical expertise and hard and soft skills in close proximity to your area of operation. The model is a blessing for companies who do not have the time to gather a team and need to start the project as soon as possible.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Disadvantages of nearshore outsourcing<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the model\u2019s drawbacks that you need to consider before making a decision:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Higher price than offshoring. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The services of outsourcing companies located in countries or regions near your area of operation will cost you more than hiring with the offshoring model.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><strong>Fewer providers<\/strong>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This disadvantage largely depends on your area of operation, but usually there a fewer nearshore companies than offshore companies.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring required<\/strong>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With nearshoring, you do not delegate the entire project to a third party and wait for the result \u2014 you need to monitor the work of the nearshoring team from time to time. This often entails hiring a project manager.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Low proficiency<\/strong>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every country has neighbouring countries with vast talent pools of developers, or simply the right experts. Sometimes, there are simply no ways to gather the right team with nearshoring and go with offshore outsourcing.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Nearshore Outsourcing Model is a Solid Option<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you plan to outsource<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your software development project using the nearshore model, your business can achieve great results \u2014 fill in the tech talent gap, build a solution from scratch, or simply finish the project the previous team failed to deliver.

Especially, it is useful for businesses that do not need to have their own development team. It might seem easy at first but every cooperation requires a detailed plan. There is no need to rush when choosing the right partner as you need a reliable, skilled team that can complete your project within stated timeframes. Although you have to take into consideration numerous details before making a deal with another company, still it is less than recruiting and training employees on your own. Sometimes it takes years to build a dream team and all the required resources for the corporation to be able to reach their goals independently. So, how to build a strategy for nearshore partnership?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have specific requirements that clearly describe your objectives. Bring together all your departments, so everyone in your team is on the same page and knows the exact tasks that should be accomplished. Your managers and you should highlight the core requirements, make them clear, specific, and easy to understand, so there will not be any confusion when communicating with the partners.<\/li>\n<li>Make a list of possible candidates for cooperation and study their work in detail. Make sure the company leads a transparent business and there are no hidden costs for the services. Check their portfolio, services they provide, go through the reviews, contact previous customers if necessary in order to get more details.<\/li>\n<li>Check whether the firm has all the necessary resources to complete the project, including staff and tech tools.<\/li>\n<li>See if you have one language in common. Language proficiency directly influences project success, so it is important for building strong and efficient relationships.<\/li>\n<li>Have meetings in person, if possible, so you can have a full picture of people you are going to work with\/ It\u2019s easier to build bridges in this way.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Nearshore outsourcing examples have shown that both teams are gaining a new and valuable experience that can be used in the future. They interact and exchange knowledge, enhance communicative skills, learn how to work with foreign companies, etc. For instance, the USA corporations often choose to partner with Canada and Mexico, as well as other LATAM countries. The EU corporations often work together or look for the partner in Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Belarus). All these countries have shown to have a huge potential in the IT field and there is a great number of talented teams. The nearshore partnership will help your company to expand its possibilities as you get access both to the professional workforce and the latest tech tools. Another important thing to check is company culture and a size of the team. Every outsourcing business wants to sell itself, so they will show only the good side. Find the data about the company on the Internet, read reviews, try to find out whether they have labor flow, or create a comfortable environment for the employees. It is important to know if in case someone decides to leave the organization it will slow down the project and they might miss a deadline. In addition to this, even if your partner is reliable and self-sufficient, you should always stay in touch with them, check whether you have the reports on the progress, make sure that all your board is also in the loop. Using a clear plan and well-thought strategy when looking for a nearshore outsourcing company will save you a lot of time and funds. Try to think of every detail beforehand and calculate the risks, it will be half of the success, and the other half will be gained in cooperation with a reliable and skilled partner.<\/p>\n<h2>Nearshore Development is On the Rise<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only the technology companies can save money by using nearshore software development outsourcing \u2014 there are many other reasons to consider this model.
