Seriously? Just to\u00a0make this basic form with a\u00a0few fields and a\u00a0couple buttons? Two weeks? You\u2019ve got to\u00a0be\u00a0kidding me! Let\u2019s see.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Is\u00a0input data validation really necessary? Sure it\u00a0is! And it\u2019s better to\u00a0divide this field into two, it\u00a0would be\u00a0more clear this way. That one needs a\u00a0mask to\u00a0be\u00a0added. And this one should be\u00a0replaced with a\u00a0dropdown list. Where do\u00a0you get options for this list? \u2013 In\u00a0the server base, of\u00a0course. How comes they are not there? Oh, yeah, we\u00a0used them in\u00a0another project\u2026well, should be\u00a0added then. Take from there and put in\u00a0here. I\u2019ll give you contacts of\u00a0the project developer, so\u00a0you can discuss the details. Actually, he\u00a0doesn\u2019t work in\u00a0our company anymore, but I\u00a0think, you can ask what and how, he\u00a0is\u00a0likely to\u00a0give the answers.<\/p>\n<p>Have we\u00a0covered everything? We\u00a0haven\u2019t? What else?<\/p>\n<p>Do\u00a0we\u00a0need a\u00a0background picture? Sure, we\u00a0do. It\u2019s all grey and dull without a\u00a0background. Yeah, our designer will do\u00a0it. He\u2019s on\u00a0holiday? Well, you can make a\u00a0place holder for now and our designer will be\u00a0back on\u00a0Monday and will make the background. No, not this Monday, the next one.<\/p>\n<p>Are we\u00a0done now? No? Seriously? What else is\u00a0there? Yeah, there are two behavioral modes \u2013 this one and that one. They both seem logical. So\u00a0we\u00a0need a\u00a0setting option for users to\u00a0be\u00a0able to\u00a0choose. No, definitely not on\u00a0this form. Can you draw a\u00a0gear that would open a\u00a0new window with the options listed? As\u00a0long as\u00a0we\u00a0have a\u00a0setting form now, let\u2019s add this and that to\u00a0it\u00a0and then let\u2019s develop according to\u00a0those settings. It\u2019s been on\u00a0my\u00a0mind for quite a\u00a0while, but we\u2019ve never managed to\u00a0start it, so\u00a0as\u00a0you will be\u00a0doing it\u00a0anyway, you can do\u00a0this thing as\u00a0well?<\/p>\n<p>Certainly with unit tests. Yeah, with integrative ones. And the localization as\u00a0well. Yeah, it\u00a0should work for both vertical and horizontal orientation. It\u00a0should also be\u00a0compatible with the previous version. Yes, asynchronously\u2026and with logs\u2026and the documentation needs corrections. How can you even ask such questions? What is\u00a0this, your first day?<\/p>\n<p>Well, have we\u00a0settled it\u00a0now? Finally! And now that everything is\u00a0crystal clear, let\u2019s assess the situation once again and define the time needed for implementation\u2026<\/p>\n<p>What do\u00a0you mean two weeks?!<\/p>\n<p><strong>The moral of\u00a0the story:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trying to\u00a0convince a\u00a0developer that the evaluated task can be\u00a0done faster is\u00a0senseless.
