These days there are tons of approaches each having its pluses and minuses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is essential to choose the smart strategy at the very beginning as well as defining your goals, objectives, budget and deadlines. That is why, we have investigated the issue to provide you with the ultimate guide on what methodology to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>History of Software Development Methodologies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It all began in 1950s and keeps on evolving, new approaches appearing until today. To put it shortly, throughout every decade, a particular methodology was supposed to best suit the needs of the time and perfect apt to solve the problems of the then days. Every new system was meant to make the development more productive and boost the desired results.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Types of Software Development Methodologies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what is the software development procedure all about? It has to do with dividing the working process into various stages, as well as delegating various task among different employees. What is more, it presupposes taking some specific approach to organizing and optimizing the whole development process and managing the team work. That is why, there are various types of methodologies aimed at improving SDLC. So here are the top ones we are going to examine.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Software Development Methodologies List<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the list below we have presented 12 most common methodologies, the gist of every approach, their advantages and disadvantages.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>1. Agile Development Methodology<\/h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-17966 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Agile-Development-Methodology-300x148.png\" alt=\"Agile Development Methodology\" width=\"300\" height=\"148\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Gist:<\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main focus of this methodology is the project\/product itself. That is why, it presupposes various constant alterations based on users and customers feedback, as well as internal changes related to the work of engineers. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agile software development methodology <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is free of rigid frameworks on the one hand. While, on the other hand, the working process is divided into short time boxes, thus offering the real results and feedbacks truly fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Benefits:<\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problems are fixed at the early stage, so the quality of the final product is often top-notch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Drawbacks:<\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is easy to get off track with all the constant changes and amendments aimed at improving the product.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>2. Waterfall Development Methodology<\/h4>\n<p><b>Gist: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The absolute opposite to the previous approach, this methodology is strict and linear. A new stage can only be started if the previous one is completed. In other words, each phase gradually flows into the next one. What is more, there is no going back to the previous stage. This approach is easy to understand as it presupposes a strict sequence of completed tasks. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waterfall methodology<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is often regarded as a classic representation of software development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Benefits: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is simple, functional, gradual and analytical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Drawbacks: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Works good with exact requirements and needs only.
