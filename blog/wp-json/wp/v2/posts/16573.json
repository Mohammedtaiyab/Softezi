This is the type of product Adero has built for its customers and earned it a top spot in the much-coveted Fast Company rating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.adero.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adero<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, formerly TrackR, whose shareholders include Amazon, Foundry and Revolution, developed a series of products and software solutions along with Activefield, a platform that can scale across many products, many companies and unlimited use cases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adero, being a well-funded startup, has been successfully reinventing itself to stay relevant as it grows together with its addressable market. Like any early stage ventures, one of Adero\u2019s challenges hinged on a need to scale its software development together with its engineering bandwidth, with the required growth vs. available local resources. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competing in a rather fragmented market of IoT-based consumer solutions for organizations, Adero aimed high, worked hard, and raced against time to go to market with an offering that would win over millennial and Generation X consumers alike. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During its quest, Adero partnered with Intellectsoft, which was able to integrate its efforts smoothly into the strides undertaken by Adero\u2019s in-house team. Understanding \u00a0IoT technologies, the intricacies of hardware design and embedded software, coupled with an innate understanding of the needs and wants of Adero\u2019s core consumers, Intellectsoft was able to contribute its skills and knowledge to the partnership, resulting in a product that lies at the core of the intelligent, easy and stress-free organization concept of Adero. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortly after the product\u2019s release, Fast Company awarded Adero the #10 spot on their list of Most Innovative Companies, alongside tech giants Apple, Google and Microsoft.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About Adero &amp; Smart Tagging System<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adero (formerly known as TrackR) is a Santa Barbara, CA-based technology company that provides an intelligent organization system aiming to end the stress and chaos that comes with managing personal things. Converging consumer electronics, hardware, the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, software, and wireless in one place, Adero\u2019s <\/span><b>Smart Tagging<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> system lets a user\u2019s life essentials manage and keep track of themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16580\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Adero-3.jpg\" alt=\"Adero\" width=\"625\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Adero-3.jpg 817w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Adero-3-300x228.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Adero-3-768x585.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Adero-3-600x457.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Adero-3-450x343.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>1 Smart Tag (parent beacon) and 3 Taglets (smaller beacons) connected to it<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how many things you have and the number of bags you use to carry them, Adero is built to ensure you never lose anything in a simple way. The logic behind Adero\u2019s product is the following. The Smart Tagging system consists of small tracking devices, parent trackers, and a custom mobile app. You place the parent beacon (called a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart Tag<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) on a bag, the smaller trackers (called <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taglets<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) on the things you usually put in that bag, and then register the bag and its tags in the mobile app. When you leave something from the bag behind, the app sends you a notification after communicating with trackers. You can organise the bags, trackers, and notifications in the app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How hard was the road to the seamlessly working final product and the customer? And where did Intellectsoft step in to play the part?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Challenges, Challenges, Challenges<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the start, Adero faced fierce competition in the tracking solutions market. The only option was creating a pitch-perfect product that would fully deliver on the premise of keeping track of personal belongings at all times. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final result needed to be simple, work seamlessly, and stand out among competitors. Adero\u2019s talented team had experience \u00a0creating similar products that enjoyed success, including the wireless speaker system from Sonos, XBox from Microsoft and the Tesla.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16581\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM.jpg\" alt=\"Adero\" width=\"501\" height=\"602\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM.jpg 571w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM-250x300-1.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM-375x450-1.jpg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The accompanying mobile app is an important part of Adero&#8217;s product<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adero began working with various development partners focusing on design, firmware, hardware, and software.
