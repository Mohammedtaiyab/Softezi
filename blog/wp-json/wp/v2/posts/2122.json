All of us have heard this a million times. It&#8217;s a common believe that Agile principles in software development work great; however, the question of how to implement them in your team, in your environment, with your clients still remain a mystery for many companies.<\/p>\n<p>The #1 principle in\u00a0the\u00a0Agile manifesto goes as: &#8220;<strong>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<\/strong>&#8220;, and this is absolutely true.\u00a0It must be said that Agile is not\u00a0just about working in iterations, doing a daily standup or writing a unit test after the all.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s hard to overestimate the role of communication in Agile team.
