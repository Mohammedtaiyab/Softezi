This term has been around for many decades and comes from a time when organizations were much more centralized. Still, as IT has been evolving as a field, and IT services as a market, an SDLC has become an important part of how companies build their software solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This post is a comprehensive analysis of a system development life cycle. By reading it, you will learn what an SDLC is, its stages, advantages and disadvantages, as well as why it is important.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Is System Development Life Cycle<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A system development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured project management model that outlines the phases required to build an IT system, from inception to the final result. The aim of a system development life cycle is to enable effective production of a high-quality solution that would meet or exceed a client\u2019s expectations throughout all its stages, within the given budget and timelines.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>7 Stages of System Development Life Cycle<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A system development life cycle is a conceptual process that explicitly breaks down the stages required to develop and implement a system. Each stage plays a significant role in the development and differs from others in complexity, required assets, and expected functionalities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a look at these stages further.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>System Development Life Cycle Phases<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are seven phases in a system development life cycle:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17373\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/System-Development-Life-Cycle-Phases.jpg\" alt=\"System Development Life Cycle Phases\" width=\"460\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/System-Development-Life-Cycle-Phases.jpg 460w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/System-Development-Life-Cycle-Phases-300x189-1.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/System-Development-Life-Cycle-Phases-450x284-1.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let&#8217;s discuss each of them separately.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1 \u2014 System Development Life Cycle: Planning<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planning is the most crucial stage of the SDLC process. It involves identifying and defining the project scope to determine a comprehensive action plan for the project, and pinpointing the issues the solution it would resolve. This phase outlines what will happen throughout the entire life cycle, and determines the success of the entire project. Team structure, timeframe, budget, security, and other fundamental factors should be accounted for at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2 \u2014 System Development Life Cycle: Analysis<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The planning is finished and the team is in place. Now, the team needs to perform an analysis of the system\u2019s functional requirements to ensure it will meet the expectations of the target audience. Those expectations are then finalized and documented. The next step is performing a feasibility study to ensure that a system makes sense from financial, technological, and organizational standpoints.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3 \u2014 System Development Life Cycle: Design<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the analysis is over and the requirements are set in stone, the design phase begins. This phase describes how to approach the design of a system\u2019s architecture, user interface(s), network, databases, and security so that they will satisfy the requirements and enable future updates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4 \u2014 System Development Life Cycle: Development<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The development marks the end of the preliminary part of the process and signifies the beginning of the production. Then, software engineers write code and fine-tunes the technologies involved in the project (this can also include hardware, for example if an IoT project is in question). This is probably the busiest stage of the life cycle, as it involves a lot of hard work from all the experts involved in it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5 \u2014 System Development Life Cycle: Testing And Integration<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This phase involves testing and integration of the system and all related procedures to assess if it performs as expected and fully delivers on the requirements. The quality assurance (QA) team is responsible for this phase.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>6 \u2014 System Development Life Cycle: Implementation And Release<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this stage, the new system is rolled out to the production environment, replacing the old one. This stage is performed by moving new data and components to where the old system was. After the implementation, the system is available to end users.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>7 \u2014 System Development Life Cycle: Maintenance<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the release, any software system enters the stage of continuous maintenance. Today, any software product needs to be frequently checked for bugs and updated with features big and small. Indeed, you product may perform well upon release, but bugs can arise anytime. As for updates, your software solution needs to adapt to quickly changing needs its end users.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>System Development Life Cycle Models<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, we will look at two different and most popular SDLC models, and one sub-model \u2014 Waterfall, Agile, and data system development life cycle, respectively. Each comes with its pros and cons that must be weighed to make a solid decision.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Waterfall Model System Development Life Cycle<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the oldest SDLC models, the Waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach that is popular in IT product development; it emphasizes the need for consistently advancing from one stage to the next one. Each stage must be fully completed before proceeding to the next; after the stage is finished, it cannot be revisited.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17374\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waterfall-System-Development-Life-Cycle-Model.jpg\" alt=\"Waterfall System Development Life Cycle Model\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waterfall-System-Development-Life-Cycle-Model.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waterfall-System-Development-Life-Cycle-Model-300x250.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Waterfall-System-Development-Life-Cycle-Model-450x375.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Waterfall model is composed of these non-overlapping stages<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Pros:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simple to understand and follow<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clear milestones and deadlines<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clear documentation<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reinforces good coding habits<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provides a solid structure<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Cons:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unsuitable for complex or object-oriented projects<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highly inflexible to scope changes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficult to estimate time and budget precisely<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A working product emerges only on later stages of the cycle<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>Agile System Development Life Cycle Methodology<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a dynamic and interactive framework, Agile has replaced the Waterfall system development life cycle<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">methodology<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and became a significant driving force behind software development in the vast majority of companies across industries.

It is important to have an SDLC in place as it helps to transform the idea of a project into a functional and completely operational structure. In addition to covering the technical aspects of system development, SDLC helps with process development, change management, user experience, and policies. Another benefit of an SDLC is that it allows for planning ahead of time, determine costs and staffing decisions, define goals, measure performance, and validate points at each phase of the cycle to boost the quality of the final product.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>System Development Life Cycle Implementation<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Waterfall model is a fitting choice for your project, you will only need an experienced project manager (or employee in a similar role) who will ensure that every stage is completed successfully and on time by working closely with the in-house team or an outsourcing partner\u2019s team.
