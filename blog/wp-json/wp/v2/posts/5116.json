The Warriors cemented the status with new records: the third-largest point differential in a single postseason in NBA history, and the highest postseason winning percentage during a four-year span in league history. On top of that, Kevin Durant won the 2018 NBA Finals MVP title for second year in a row, putting him in the company with Michael Jordan, Shaquille O&#8217;Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James as the only players in NBA history to win Finals MVP in at least two-straight seasons. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Warriors are the best basketball team of the modern age for one more reason: there is no other team that embraces new technologies so eagerly. The team was among the first in the league to install player tracking cameras in their home stadium to record everything a player does during the game, and uses this data to their advantage. The Warriors also plan to open <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/peterhigh\/2016\/12\/05\/golden-state-warriors-new-arena-will-set-standard-for-fan-experience\/#2d82dce839a3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a new arena<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Mission Bay Area of San Francisco for the 2019-2020 season \u2014 to deliver an all-around, world-class fan experience bolstered by technology innovation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5121\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_683804491.jpg\" alt=\"Warriors chatbot\" width=\"632\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_683804491.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_683804491-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_683804491-768x405.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_683804491-600x316.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/shutterstock_683804491-450x237.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile is part of delivering that experience.

The bot\u2019s design is based on the <\/span><b>guided model<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: the users can conveniently swipe through home arena and team news, game information, and quickly buy items from the Warrior\u2019s shop. Second, the users can type in essential one-word commands to call up corresponding content (for example, \u201cscore\u201d will prompt the bot to share detailed information on the latest game).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the most popular feature is <\/span><b>live updates<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When the team plays, the Warriors chatbot delivers notifications about key moments at the end of every quarter. The content is diverse and comes in various statistics, scoring notifications, videos, and other. As a result, the fans never miss out on anything about their favorite team\u2019s game. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the latest features is a season-long quiz-like challenge for the fans. Upon engaging in it, the bot sends a user a series of questions before every game, prompting them to guess the outcome of a quarter, how much a player would score, and other. At a season\u2019s end, the chatbot would reveal a table showing how much each participant scored. The top guesser wins an exclusive prize from the Warriors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Golden State Warriors is a team always open to continuous innovation, new Golden State Warriors chatbot features can be expected to arrive in the following seasons. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about our software solutions for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/sports-apps\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sports and teams<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The legendary teams excels off the court with fan experience as much as on it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":63,"featured_media":5117,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2,13],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The legendary team wins on the digital court again.
