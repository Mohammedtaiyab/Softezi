While AR eliminates long-standing stumbling blocks, it also helps to perform an action easily, quickly, and more comfortably \u2014 whether it is accessing a patient\u2019s body scan in a hologram, or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/ar-construction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">building better BIM models in the construction industry<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Furthermore, positive results of implementation of an AR solutions are immediate in most cases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Existing <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">augmented reality applications in design in manufacturing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> illustrate the powerful impact of the technology clearly, from Boeing elevating their wire assembly process \u2014 to Porsche ensuring the highest level of product quality before sending cars to their customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discover how AR improves key stages of the manufacturing process for the world\u2019s biggest brands below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Ford Motor Company \u2014 Design<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ford has leveraged the promise of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">augmented reality manufacturing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to overhaul their design process. At the heart of this transformation is Microsoft HoloLens AR headset. With the device, Ford\u2019s design teams can see potential designs of a car (or its part) overlayed over a physical prototype in real scale. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has brought a long list of benefits to Ford. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Augmented reality for manufacturing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allowed the company\u2019s designers to be more creative, improve decision making, collaborate better, as well as work quicker. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Microsoft HoloLens: Partner Spotlight with Ford\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3QyA7HhIYkg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The information that is crucial to car design comes from multiple sources in Ford, and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">augmented reality manufacturing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has also made it easier for the company to manage it on the spot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concurrently, one of the features is the ability to leave comments in AR, so that other team members can access them. Taken that you can operate in AR remotely (this process is called teleoperation), the solution becomes a very powerful and proficient combination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>\u201cHoloLens gives us a simple way of understanding extremely complex information\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elizabeth Baron \u2014 VR &amp; Advanced Visualization Technical Specialist at Ford Motor Company<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, Ford also uses AR apps in their design process. For instance, AR apps can be used to access a prototype, as an auxiliary tool to a headset.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Boeing \u2014 Assembly<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">augmented reality in manufacturing industry<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help companies solve the most complex challenges. Here, Boeing\u2019s case of brining Google Glass to the wire assembly process of their 787-8 Freighter is the top highlight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the AR technology, Boeing\u2019s employees needed to continuously consult a laptop to ensure that numerous wires are correctly assembled. The process caused fatigue in employees and was time-consuming in general. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With AR headsets, the company\u2019s employees now have the same information right before their eyes, making Boeing\u2019s wire assembly process faster and more comfortable. They can also issue voice commands conveniently and ask a colleague to join the headset\u2019s video stream to assist with complex tasks. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Upskill and Boeing Use Skylight to Reinvent Wire Harness Assembly\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qTblKJjTadQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">augmented reality manufacturing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reduced Boeing\u2019s wire assembly process time by 25 percent and lowered errors to nearly zero percent. More so, the solution significantly improved employee satisfaction and, consequently, employee retention. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Lockheed Martin \u2014 Training<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">augmented reality applications in manufacturing <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">go, employee training is where the technology excels with even greater force. The assembly process of Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 aircraft lasted years, but AR technology reduced the time by 30 percent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From engine parts to cables and bolts, the company\u2019s engineers use Microsoft HoLolens headsets to view the holographic renderings of an aircraft\u2019s parts, as well as the instructions on how to assemble them \u2014 right before their eyes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>&#8220;At Lockheed Martin, we see the HoloLens being a tremendous benefit in terms of 3D, the speed and quality that we can do our work.&#8221; <\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Darin Bolthouse, an engineering manager at Lockheed Martin, in a comment to <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.computerworld.com\/article\/3184644\/virtual-reality\/augmented-reality-gets-a-second-life-in-manufacturing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Computer World<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Digitalising the workflow with\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">augmented reality in manufacturing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has helped Lockheed Martin increase engineering efficiency to astounding 96 percent, a crucial number for such a demanding industry. <\/span><i><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><b>Porsche \u2014 Quality Assurance<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porsche has already built their factory of the future in Zuffenhausen, a massive engine plant for the latest V8 engine assembly that uses robots for a number of tasks.
