Here,<\/span><\/i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they pinpoint the highest and most memorable moments, and share their overall impressions of the acclaimed event.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.slush.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slush 2016<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> opened with literal<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fire \u2014 a fire show, to be exact. The kick-off to the two-day event was full of prominent presentations, fireside panel discussions and networking, and proved incredibly uplifting, reminding the 17,500 attendees that technology is a grand beacon of hope that illuminates the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The themes were similarly hot: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/healthcare\">healthcare<\/a> innovations, cleantech, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/finance-banking\">fintech<\/a>, and bitcoin, as well as how the traditional corporate world gears up the adoption of technologies to get in line with the deftly dealing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/startups\">startups<\/a>. We were most impressed with the speech from tech startup Atomico, who shared the enlightening statistics<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that two-thirds of the largest European companies made direct investments into startups, while one-third has acquired a startup since 2015. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, the founders of Spotify and Supercell stepped onto the glaring stage to discuss failure in business \u2014 how it puts us on a learning path to become better, and its inherent link to founding a company. Most interestingly,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spotify admitted that they nearly missed the impact of mobile on the world three years ago. The subject of failure in business and in general might seem rather burdening, but the speakers and event\u2019s overall positive tone forestalled any negative vibes in the audience, making the talks enormously educational and fun. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there was Slush 100 \u2014 a two-day, three-stage pitching competition between one hundred startups preselected by international investors from thousands of applications. At the end of the second day there were four finalists. Naturally, there can only be one winner. This year, \u20ac500,000 equity investment went to CybelAngel \u2014 a startup that runs security checks not indexed by Google, using big data algorithms. They hit the jackpot for two reasons. First, CybelAngel addresses the biggest risk spot of digital businesses \u2014 data security. Second, the company\u2019s COO made a charismatic pitch \u2014 our sincere congratulations to Evelyne! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even the runner-ups<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">included amazing companies: Shipwallet (revolutionising B2C shipping with AI), SketchOn (printing temporary tattoos on skin), and SendBird (helping people and businesses to have meaningful conversations in mobile chat). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VR is one of the big buzzwords this year, and Slush didn\u2019t miss out on pronouncing it. We have thoroughly enjoyed the immersive experience created by Nokia\u2019s new OZO VR camera, which was also<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presented at the event. Built for professional use, OZO is capable of creating a spherical VR environment ten times faster than other devices and has a 360-degree video and sound capture. A lot of pioneering devices are presented to public for testing only to become available later on \u2014 a year after presentation or so. Surprisingly enough, OZO was launched on the first day of Slush, and we are really proud<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we were there to witness! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Slush delivered another top-notch event that is poised to be industry-igniting and spark new ingenious startups and long-lasting friendships in tech. Intellectsoft looks forward to visiting Slush in 2017 \u2014 to listen to the brightest minds in the industry, to discuss AR and other looming game-changers, network, and to simply have fun. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Intellectsoft&#8217;s takeaways from Slush 2016, a two-day tech conference in Helsinki.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":63,"featured_media":3560,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 -
