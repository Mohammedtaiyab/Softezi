If you&#8217;ve ever used the internet before, your answer is probably yes. Seen as a buzzword by many, machine learning\u2014together with big data, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality\u2014is currently one of the most widely discussed concepts in the technology community.<\/p>\n<p>Buzzword or not, machine learning has long since become something we use every day, one way or another. It&#8217;s working behind the scenes in most of our mobile apps, under the hood of most websites we visit, and is employed by the brands and service providers with whom we interact.<\/p>\n<p>The ubiquity of machine learning has led to the creation of a number of ways to quickly and easily integrate it into virtually any application. On the flip side, it has become even more important to understand clearly what machine learning is, what it isn&#8217;t, and where it should be applied to achieve the best results.<\/p>\n<p class=\"upgrades\">We&#8217;ve also made a PDF-version of this article.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.getdrip.com\/forms\/87318719\/submissions\/new\" data-drip-show-form=\"87318719\">Download<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Simple Explanation of Machine Learning<\/h2>\n<p>The concept of machine learning, as it&#8217;s being used in smart applications today, is basically a way of making \u00a0highly accurate predictions of the future using data (as in Big Data) from the past. This can take various forms, from article recommendations on newspapers&#8217; websites, to fraud detection in online stores, to sentiment analysis of interaction on social networks.<\/p>\n<p>Since machine learning is often intertwined with the concept of artificial intelligence (AI), it&#8217;s also quite important to understand the difference between the two. In fact, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, which, in turn, is the concept that a computer can learn to do anything a human can.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13395\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/machine-learning-and-AI.png\" alt=\"machine learning and AI\" width=\"450\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/machine-learning-and-AI.png 615w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/machine-learning-and-AI-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/machine-learning-and-AI-600x450.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/machine-learning-and-AI-450x337.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As opposed to AI, machine learning algorithms don&#8217;t necessarily act by itself, but rather works with data and supplies certain conclusions and predictions based on its analysis. The core of machine learning consists of a wide variety of algorithms, which should be chosen according to the nature of the task at hand and \u201ctrained\u201d with data from the past.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13397\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/75-and-25-percent-dependance.png\" alt=\"75 and 25 percent dependance\" width=\"450\" height=\"95\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/75-and-25-percent-dependance.png 935w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/75-and-25-percent-dependance-300x63.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/75-and-25-percent-dependance-768x162.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/75-and-25-percent-dependance-600x126.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/75-and-25-percent-dependance-450x95.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This past data is also crucial for validating \u00a0the predictions: <strong>normally 75%<\/strong> of the available data would be used for prediction, which would then be compared to the <strong>remaining 25%<\/strong>. This way, one can fine-tune the algorithms by trying to \u201cpredict\u201d the past.<\/p>\n<h2>Time to act<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s been no better time to start implementing machine learning in all kinds of applications, Google&#8217;s <strong>Aparna Chennapragada<\/strong> argued in her talk at the recent TNW Europe conference. The evolution of the internet has meant that data has reached a different order of magnitude to what it was ten years ago, with videos, photos, social media posts, and online behaviour data generated by billions of users.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, most people now have ambient access to enormous computing power. The mobile paradigm changes and enhances the way we interact with our environment\u2014thanks, in no small measure, to machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. With huge amounts of data and so many computers at hand, now is the best time to build smart applications, which can help users achieve more and make their everyday lives easier.<\/p>\n<p>One good thing about building smart applications with machine learning is that almost every problem today can be solved with software. These new solutions include entertainment at home, transportation and dispatching cars through traffic, monitoring health and fitness, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re building a product now that solves a real world problem, chances are you will need to work with information problems, and you&#8217;ll have to figure out how to get it right,&#8221; Chennapragada said.<\/p>\n<p>With the wide variety of information problems we&#8217;re facing, it&#8217;s important to recognise \u00a0those cases where machine learning would be an efficient solution. The perfect problem in this case would be one that&#8217;s hard for a human to solve, but easy for the machine.<\/p>\n<p>A good example is machine translation. Despite not always being 100% accurate, it satisfies users in most cases, since without the machine they wouldn&#8217;t be able to translate at all. On the other hand, inaccurate speech recognition is quite frustrating, as the user can actually type the query manually. The easier the problem is for a human, the more difficult it becomes to satisfy your users with a machine learning-based solution.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Werner Vogels<\/strong>, the CTO of Amazon, gave another good example of the use of machine learning in his talk at TNW Conference. The online retail behemoth uses algorithms to fight the paradox of choice, which is that after a certain number of options, the increase in choice actually makes customers less happy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf there are only three kinds of toothpaste, you choose one and you&#8217;re happy with your choice,\u201d Vogels said. \u201cBut if there are 50, you get confused. You need to make a choice, but you&#8217;re not sure you&#8217;ve chosen the best one. It&#8217;s a big driver for unhappiness.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis is important in grocery stores, but even more important online: we have not 50, but 5,000 toothpastes. Personalisation with machine learning helps reduce choices and make users happier.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>The secret sauce<\/h2>\n<p>Personalisation is another requirement that Chennapragada listed amongst the most important features of a smart application. Although there&#8217;s no universal formula for a successful product in this field, there is something that the app creators should keep in mind for reference:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13393\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AI-plus-I.png\" alt=\"AI-plus-I\" width=\"740\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AI-plus-I.png 1480w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AI-plus-I-300x96.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AI-plus-I-768x246.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AI-plus-I-1024x329.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AI-plus-I-600x193.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AI-plus-I-450x144.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/AI-plus-I-1000x321.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence and user interface need little explanation, and \u201cI\u201d means that the product has to adapt to the needs of every user in every scenario. Knowing your audience and their needs is key, and a failure to fulfil these needs \u00a0inevitably leads to the product being abandoned.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to knowing the audience, it&#8217;s important to be able to show your users the benefits of your smart application early on, Chennapragada added. A good example of that is Google-owned Waze that uses machine learning and real-time data to predict traffic jams and navigate the user around them. The app adds value from the very first time it&#8217;s launched on the phone\u2014and that&#8217;s something worth aiming for.<\/p>\n<p>A big part of Chennapragada&#8217;s advice on building smart applications with machine learning algorithms can be boiled down to \u201cdon&#8217;t frighten your user\u201d and \u201cdon&#8217;t screw up in mission critical tasks.\u201d In particular, customers would generally prefer having a predictable interface over saving some time; for example, Google&#8217;s team at some point came up with an algorithm that could dynamically change the icon grid on the smartphone to highlight the apps that the customer was more likely to need at any given moment. The feature never went live.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the rule of thumb when it comes to building UI for smart apps is that its simplicity should be proportionate to your confidence in AI. Whenever you&#8217;re not entirely sure that the AI has got your user&#8217;s intention correctly, let the latter clarify it further. The more training your algorithms receive this way, the better they become in the future.<\/p>\n<h2>Starting up<\/h2>\n<p>With machine learning gaining popularity across industries, it is slowly but surely becoming as ubiquitous as computing itself. In fact, you don&#8217;t even need to have an in-depth knowledge of coding or computer science to introduce it into your app. With machine learning tools released by a number of companies it can be done within an hour, provided you have sufficient data to start with.<\/p>\n<p>Recently we ran an overview of APIs for natural language processing, most of which employ machine learning algorithms. Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the most popular solutions you can use for other aspects of your new smart applications.<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/machine-learning\/\">Amazon Machine Learning<\/a><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/amazonml01.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-13411\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/amazonml01.png\" alt=\"Adding a data source for a model on Amazon ML\" width=\"740\" height=\"407\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/amazonml01.png 1480w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/amazonml01-300x165.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/amazonml01-768x422.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/amazonml01-1024x563.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/amazonml01-600x330.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/amazonml01-450x248.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/amazonml01-1000x550.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The retail giant offers a cloud-based machine learning service that it claims is similar to what is used within the company for all sorts of predictions. Examples of possible uses for this product are fraud detection, content personalisation, document classification, and customer churn prediction.<\/p>\n<p>The API comes with SDKs for Java, .NET, Python, PHP, Node.js, and Ruby. Amazon provides ample documentation for the product, which could, nevertheless be slightly \u00a0difficult for a non-programmer to follow in some cases. In combination with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, the solution can scale to &#8220;generate billions of predictions daily, and serve those predictions in real-time and at high throughput.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Amazon Machine Learning API charges $0.42 per hour of computing while analysing your data and building models. After that, you&#8217;ll need to pay $0.10 per 1,000 predictions if purchased in a batch, or $0.0001 per real-time prediction. The API is not available on the AWS free tier, which means that you might need to pay for it separately.<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/services\/machine-learning\/\">Microsoft Azure ML<\/a><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Microsoft-Azure-ML-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-13385\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Microsoft-Azure-ML-1.jpg\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Microsoft-Azure-ML-1.jpg 1480w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Microsoft-Azure-ML-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Microsoft-Azure-ML-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Microsoft-Azure-ML-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Microsoft-Azure-ML-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Microsoft-Azure-ML-1-450x253.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Microsoft-Azure-ML-1-1000x563.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Another offering crafted by a major tech corporation, Azure ML is part of a bigger Cortana Intelligence Suite.
