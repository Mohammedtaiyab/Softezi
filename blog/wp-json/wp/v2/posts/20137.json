AI is getting increasingly sophisticated at doing what the health-sector workforce does. But more efficiently, more quickly and at a lower cost. According to the World Health Organization, by 2030, the global industry can create 40 million new jobs, and this is a huge potential for AI growth too.<\/p>\n<h2>Explosive Growth of AI<\/h2>\n<p>AI has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare sector and help address some of the challenges we consider in this article too. Today, there are at least <b>six core areas where AI is already having an impact:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Care delivery;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chronic care management;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-care, prevention, wellness;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Triage and diagnosis;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diagnostics;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clinical decision support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These six areas have a direct impact on the healthcare value chain, including improving population health management, improving operations, and straightening innovation. With immense power to unleash improvements in cost, quality, and access, AI is gaining its momentum and becoming an extremely popular technology in the industry. By 2021, the AI health market is expected to reach $6.6 billion.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>In just the next five years, the health AI market will grow more than 10x.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20142\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1.jpg\" alt=\"AI market 2020\" width=\"1853\" height=\"971\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1.jpg 1853w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1-768x402.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1-1536x805.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1-600x314.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1-450x236.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1-1000x524.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1853px) 100vw, 1853px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We can only imagine a future in which population-level data from wearables and implants change our understanding of human biology.

The lockdown is stretching operational systems in healthcare and beyond. We have seen shortages of everything, from masks and gloves to ventilators, and from emergency room capacity to ICU beds to the speed and reliability of internet connectivity. Lots of patients tend to seek medical help online and through the device-based frames. We\u2019re going to witness more examples in the foreseen future.<\/p>\n<h2>The Four Groups of AI Use Cases Today<\/h2>\n<p>To have a closer look at the high potential for scale, the impact, the possibilities, and the bottlenecks of AI use cases in healthcare, we grouped them in four logical categories:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-enabled population health;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient virtual health assistant;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frontline health worker (FHW) virtual health assistant;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physician clinical decision support tools.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The <b>AI-enabled population health<\/b> stands for analyzing and providing recommendations on residents&#8217; health data.

It helps FHW to make data-driven decisions, track behavioral changes, set diagnosis, lead medical records, and personalize outreach.<\/p>\n<p>The last group stands for providing more specialized expertise to generalist physicians. Image-based diagnosis, clinical decision support, QA, and training are just a few examples of its realization.<\/p>\n<h2>No More Science Fiction<\/h2>\n<p>AI represents a significant opportunity for industry players to manage their bottom line in a new payment landscape while capitalizing on new growth potential.

The AI-assisted surgical procedure is also acknowledged as \u201cminimally invasive surgery,\u201d which minimizes chance elements with the aid of streamlining a subculture of innovation and entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<p>The recent advancements in AI have spurred healthcare carriers and pharmaceutical organizations to deploy the technological know-how and beautify their operations. The investments have yielded widespread fee cuts and extended outcomes. Robotics outcomes include a 21% reduction in length of stay. The value will only increase with the development of robotic solutions for a greater diversity of surgeries.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Boosting Nursing Efficiency<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The virtual nursing assistant is another frontrunner of AI disruption in healthcare.

AI systems have the potential to assist reduce time and effort for administrative workflow capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>For example, voice-to-text transcription, eliminating non-patient care activities including writing chart notes, prescriptions and ordering tests. AI systems are developed to empower medical personnel to furnish a greater stage of care by helping them with compliance in every step of the process.<\/p>\n<h2>Better Care, On Your Terms<\/h2>\n<p>AI is here. From medical lookup to health center care, drug development, and insurance, statistics management by using AI functions radically changes the health sector to minimize expenditure and facilitate patient outcomes. And those who seize the AI opportunity and embrace these applications to deliver high-quality, cost-effective care will be the ones to leapfrog competitors.<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s a long and complex journey which no single organization should take alone.
