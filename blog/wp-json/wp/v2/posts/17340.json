By delegating a wide range of software development tasks to an offshore software service provider, a company saves a lot of time and effort on hiring, managing, and maintaining a software development team as well as cost associated with all these steps.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This post will show you whether offshore outsourcing of software development projects is beneficial for your business, and how to avoid mistakes in selecting the right company and cooperating with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How Offshore Software Development Works?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process of software development offshoring starts by hiring new employees overseas. Experts hired on the basis of offshoring work full-time and the cost of their services is almost three times lower as compared to employing in-house employees. The offshore team is responsible for the entire software development, testing, and maintenance and communicates with the client in the process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Pros And Cons Of Offshore Software Development Outsourcing<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17341\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Outsourcing-Pros-and-Cons.jpg\" alt=\"Offshore Software Development Outsourcing Pros and Cons\" width=\"800\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Outsourcing-Pros-and-Cons.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Outsourcing-Pros-and-Cons-300x134-1.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Outsourcing-Pros-and-Cons-768x344-1.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Outsourcing-Pros-and-Cons-600x269-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Outsourcing-Pros-and-Cons-450x201-1.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following are some of the advantages that you can expect from the offshore software development process:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Pros<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Cost-effectiveness<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With offshoring, companies can save up to 30% of their expenses. This includes costs on recruitment and salary. Also, they do not need to spend money on hardware and software as these costs will be taken care of by the offshore software development company.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><strong>Attention to core activities<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>.<\/strong> The management can spend more time on planning and directing the company\u2019s business strategies while the offshore software development partner handles the technology-related project. Thus, it allows companies to focus more on core business activities.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Task-specific experts<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With software offshoring, you can hire a scalable team only for a certain project, without committing to long-term hiring. After the release of the product, you can scale down your team to a small unit that would maintain and update your software solution. The vast majority of offshore software development companies offer the option.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Access to a larger talent pool<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Choosing to offshore your software development gives you access to a vast tech talent pool whose engineers have the experience in creating software with the latest technologies, and will help you stay ahead of the competition.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Faster time-to-market<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Modern businesses understand that speed is essential to staying competitive. The option of turning to offshore software development company is the shortcut to reducing your product\u2019s time-to-market dramatically.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Cons<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delegating some of your business tasks to a third-party vendor may sound like a good idea. However, we are going to shed light on some of the shortcomings of offshoring:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Demands continuous management<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As it is not your in-house team and every software solution consists of an endless number of details, you need to monitor your offshore team to see if everything goes as planned and according to the project requirements. Or, you can hire a project manager who will manage the team, which means allocating additional costs.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Differences in time zone and culture<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Your company and your offshore team will work in different time zones and may come from different cultures. This will inevitably affect the productivity of both sides and might extend the deadline.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Hidden costs<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While companies go for offshoring to save some money, some offshore software development companies include hidden costs into the price of their services. Partner only with reputable offshore providers that do not raise any suspicions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Risk of data theft<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When you offshoring, you inevitably share ideas, innovations, and sensitive information with a third-party, and the risk of data theft is always present.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Top Offshore Software Development Risks<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17342\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Risks.jpg\" alt=\"Offshore Software Development Risks\" width=\"850\" height=\"446\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Risks.jpg 850w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Risks-300x157.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Risks-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Risks-600x315.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Offshore-Software-Development-Risks-450x236.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to in-house <\/span>software development, offshore<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> outsourcing involves potential risks. Before starting to cooperate with an outsourcing software development company, business owners might need to consider the following risks:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Data privacy risk<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Privacy has always been a top priority. So, you need to find a reputable offshore software development company with comprehensive security policies and sign an NDA agreement with them.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Communication risk<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Communication risks come into play due to the lack of face-to-face communication, ESL (English as a Second Language) barriers, time zone differences, and cultural differences. You can mitigate these risks by partnering with an offshore software development company that offers flexibility in your engagement with their team. This may include bi-monthly visits to your offshoring partner\u2019s office, hiring more experienced engineers with advanced English, and other.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Quality risk<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does not always apply to software development offshoring. Not every company delivers quality results. So, select a trusted company that can meet your technical requirements and follow project documentation thoroughly.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Management risk<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Managing a remote team can be difficult. Still, you can succeed in it by organizing a streamlined workflow. External and internal teams should collaborate closely to stay informed on the current state of the project and cooperate on issues that need involvement of both sides. This way, management risks can be reduced and the project can be better coordinated.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>How To Manage an Offshore Software Development Team?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing an offshore software development team is challenging. To face them successfully, managers needs to coordinate employees and leverage all assets effectively.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the essentials of managing your offshore team:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Communicate effectively. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain continuous communication with the offshore team to see if they follow deadlines and requirements.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><strong>Arrange visits<\/strong>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit your team to work with them for a few of days for better collaboration and team building.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Use collaboration tools<\/strong>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use JIRA or similar systems for task tracking and reporting, Slack for instant messaging, and Skype or Zoom for video calls.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Provide feedback<\/strong>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discuss the project\u2019s progress and give feedback to your team frequently.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Treat your offshore team as your in-house team<\/strong>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid keeping your offshore team at an arm\u2019s length. Instead, try to make a connection with them on your meetings by having short discussions on casual topics, asking them how they are doing, and so on. You can also give bonuses and increase salaries if you have a long-term project.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Offshore Software Development Best Practices<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most companies today leverage software development offshoring. Still, if you are offshoring for the first time or need to guide someone responsible for managing an offshore team, we have some basic tips.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the best practices of offshore software development outsourcing that will help you cooperate with your development partner effectively:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Define your goals<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Establish clear, actionable goals and document everything in detail.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Choose the right partner<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Carefully explore available companies and evaluate the potential offshoring partner. Do they have a clear understanding of your business requirements? Do they have experience in your industry? Does your potential partner have a time-tested development approach? Are their previous clients satisfied with the company\u2019s work?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Stay in the loop<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Collaborate with the offshore team to know the current project progress and whether there are any issues or obstacles.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Maximize engagement<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by recognizing the offshore team\u2019s input and success and hold them accountable for problems.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Store reusable components<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Build a library of frequently your in-house team or other outsourcing provider you may hire in the future can use for quick development of new software to time, costs, and efforts.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Offshore Software Development Common Issues<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are some of the most common issues of offshore software development outsourcing that you need to be aware of beforehand:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Culture gap<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The employees of the vast majority of offshore companies will come from cultures different from yours and be less fluent in English. This means their approach to work may be different from yours, among other things we discussed above.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Lack of transparency<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Handing over some of your in-house projects means that you often disclose sensitive corporate information. Some companies prefer not to share it with their offshoring vendor under any circumstances, which may impede the software development process.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Replicated\/sold code<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In some countries, breaking an NDA agreement is not enforced by law. In case your offshoring partner comes from one of these countries, you need to have legal agreements that confirm your company owns the code.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Lack of documentation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The absence of software documentation or unclear business requirements may lead to a poor quality end product.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>What Are the Cost Components Of Offshore Software Development?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key cost components of software development offshoring are infrastructure cost, service cost, and maintenance cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17343\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/The-Cost-Of-The-Components-For-Offshore-Software-Development.jpg\" alt=\"The Cost Of The Components For Offshore Software Development\" width=\"535\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/The-Cost-Of-The-Components-For-Offshore-Software-Development.jpg 535w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/The-Cost-Of-The-Components-For-Offshore-Software-Development-300x151.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/The-Cost-Of-The-Components-For-Offshore-Software-Development-450x226.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are other major cost components common to offshore software development outsourcing:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hiring and training\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Development<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Project management\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality assurance<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintenance<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Auxiliary costs<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Top Countries For Offshore Software Development<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/outsourcing-software-development-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">outsourcing<\/a>, offshoring has become the ultimate solution for businesses that need quality software developed quickly.
