Now, the trader and buyer sign a smart contract with the following logic encoded into it: as soon as the buyer receives their item, their payment is automatically transferred to the trader. Neither of the sides has to do anything: the process is fully automated with code. They just agree upon the terms and put their digital signatures on the smart contract.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other nuances can also be coded into a smart contract. For example, if an item arrives damaged, the trader receives only a part of the sum. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequently, if a standard legal contract would include terms of relations enforced by law, a blockchain-based smart contract enforces the relations between all involved parties with cryptographic code. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike a legal contract, a smart contract doesn\u2019t have legal power. Instead it relies on blockchain technology:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart contracts are stored on a blockchain and visible to every <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/currency-free-bitcoin-blockchain-essentials\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">node<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, like a blockchain block. As blockchain is an append-only database (blocks cannot be deleted, only added), all agreements are always open to audit.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If someone decides to change the contents of a contract, everyone on a blockchain will see it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a smart contract executes an operation encoded into it (for example, transfers the payment), this information is updated to every party. As a result, every party can follow the process of contract execution. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nodes validate smart contracts like blocks. If a smart contract is questionable (for example, coming from a node that looks malevolent), it won\u2019t become a part of a blockchain. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Smart contracts can perform the following functions:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manage agreements between users.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Function as multi-signature accounts (payment is sent only when all nodes agree)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Store information<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>The benefits of smart contracts:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accuracy. If a smart contract is well-coded, there\u2019s a negligible chance of error.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speed. Smart contract automate processes and don\u2019t require any manual operations.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fewer risks. Blockchain is a decentralised database, so smart contracts don\u2019t entail the risks, costs, and issues of legal contracts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fewer mediators. Smart contracts remove or gradually reduce the role of trust services providers. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Smart Contracts Usage Cases<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, we will explore how the usage cases of different complexity. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Small agreements on an existing blockchain<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If one needs to arrange small agreements like the example above and they don\u2019t need to do it often, they can create smart contracts on an existing blockchain with smart contracts support. One of them is Ethereum, where the concept of smart contracts was introduced to public. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Smart contracts with more than 2 parties<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A company delivers a shipment of products to their client. This time, the order was made to a faraway region, and the company doesn\u2019t have a vehicle or partner in the region to transport the goods safely. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company hires a transporter. As client trust and a substantial sum of money are at stake, the company wants to ensure everything goes as planned \u2014 the goods will reach the client safely and on time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, smart contracts become the solution. All parties create and sign an agreement with the following logic: <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transporter is paid their share when the goods are safely delivered to the client.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The client\u2019s payment is transferred to the company when the client confirms that the goods are safely delivered within the set deadline.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><b>Smart contracts in crowdfunding<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crowdfunding is an effective, current-day way to raise money. Blockchain-based smart contracts improve it further. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform as an example. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A company puts out a project they need to raise money for to Kickstarter. The people who are interested in the project will start transferring funds to Kickstarter, which acts as an intermediary. If the project reaches the set money goal, Kickstarter transfers to the company. If it doesn\u2019t, the funds go back to the investors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain-based smart contracts translate this logic into code and eliminate the intermediary, automating the entire process. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart contracts are a relatively new approach to business operations. As of today, each business case requires a custom solution for the most effective outcome. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As smart contracts continue gaining traction in various industries, the upcoming years will bring out the following possibilities:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Custom smart contract templates for different industries and usage cases.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart legal contracts \u2014 documents that combine smart contracts and standard legal contracts, as well as a legislative base to allow businesses use them.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart contracts that leverage IoT to automate complex business processes.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will dedicate our next post to how smart contracts work with IoT and explore different examples in detail, as the convergence of smart contracts and IoT is already happening in a wide range of industries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Meanwhile, if you are already considering deploying smart contracts on blockchain in your enterprise, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/contacts\">get in touch<\/a> with us.
