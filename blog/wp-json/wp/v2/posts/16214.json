That is why we now have various big data frameworks in the market to choose from. Apache Spark and Hadoop are two of such big data frameworks, popular due to their efficiency and applications. While we do have a choice, picking up the right one has become quite difficult. Perhaps, performing a downright comparison of the pros and cons of these tools would be no good as well, since this will not highlight the particular usefulness of a tool. Instead, this article performs a detailed Apache Spark vs Hadoop MapReduce comparison, highlighting their performance, architecture, and use cases.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Before delving into a detailed comparison, we will briefly explore what Spark and Hadoop are.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let\u2019s start exploring the frameworks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What is Apache Spark<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Apache Spark is a real-time data analytics framework that mainly executes in-memory computations in a distributed environment. It offers incredible processing speed, making it desirable for everyone interested in big data analytics. <a href=\"https:\/\/spark.apache.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Spark<\/a> can either work as a stand-alone tool or can be associated with Hadoop YARN. Since it flaunts faster data processing, it is suitable for repeated processing of data sets. Nonetheless, it requires more power.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What is MapReduce, or Hadoop MapReduce<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>MapReduce is what constitutes the core of <a href=\"https:\/\/hadoop.apache.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Apache Hadoop<\/a>, which is an open source framework. The MapReduce programming model lets Hadoop first store and then process big data in a distributed computing environment. This makes it capable of processing large data sets, particularly when RAM is less than data. Hadoop does not have the speed of Spark, so it works best for economical operations not requiring immediate results.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Hadoop MapReduce vs Spark \u2013 Detailed Comparison<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Both Spark and Hadoop serve as big data frameworks, seemingly fulfilling the same purposes. However, they have several differences in the way they approach data processing. Here, we draw a comparison of the two from various viewpoints.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Spark vs MapReduce Performance<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At a glance, anyone can randomly label Spark a winner considering the data processing speed. Nonetheless, delving into the details of the performance of Hadoop and Spark reveals more facts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"455\" class=\"wp-image-16351\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-1024x455.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-1024x455.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-300x133.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-768x341.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-600x267.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-450x200.jpeg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-1000x444.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop.jpeg 1049w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Spark vs Hadoop big data analytics\u00a0visualisation<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Apache Spark Performance<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As said above, Spark is faster than Hadoop. This is because of its in-memory processing of the data, which makes it suitable for real-time analysis. Nonetheless, it requires a lot of memory since it involves caching until the completion of a process. So, if the data fits well into memory, Spark can become the right option.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>MapReduce Performance<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Hadoop processes data by first storing it across a distributed environment, and then processing it in parallel. The software is basically designed to process data gathered from various sources. Thus, it takes quite some time to show results. In other words, Hadoop should not be considered for data processing where faster results are needed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, if speed and time are not critical, then Hadoop outperforms Spark Apache as it conveniently handles large data sets, is capable of handling hardware failures, and does not require a lot of processing memory. Besides, unlike Spark, it does not require caching, thus saving up memory.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Hadoop vs <\/strong><strong>Apache Spark Language<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Hadoop MapReduce and Spark not only differ in performance but are also written in different languages. Hadoop is usually written in Java that supports MapReduce functionalities. Nonetheless, Python may also be used if required.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, Apache Spark is mainly written in Scala. But\u200e, it also comes with APIs for \u200eJava\u200e, \u200ePython\u200e, R, and SQL. Hence, it offers more options to the developers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Spark and MapReduce Architecture<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Spark and MapReduce both perform data analytics in a distributed computing environment. However, both the software process a given dataset differently. Below we explain and compare the architecture when it comes to Spark vs MapReduce.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Apache Spark Architecture<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Spark is a clustered computing system that has RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) as its fundamental data structure. This data structure makes Spark resilient to faults and failure when processing data distributed over multiple nodes and managing partitioned datasets of values. It is RDD\u2019s capability to exploit the power of multiple nodes in a cluster that makes it faster and tolerant to faults.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While executing data analysis, Spark Apache manages the distribution of datasets over various nodes in a cluster, creating RDDs. RDD is an immutable collection of objects that may be lazily transformed via Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Each dataset in an RDD is divided into multiple logical partitions facilitating in parallel computation across different nodes in the cluster.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the cluster, the <em>master node<\/em> holds the driver program where the Spark Context is created for smooth execution of all Spark functionalities. The Spark Context collaborates with the <em>Cluster Manager<\/em> to manage a task. Besides, the Spark architecture also consists of <em>Worker Nodes<\/em> that hold data cache, perform task execution, and return the results to the Spark Context. The number of Worker Nodes may be increased as desired for faster processing. However, it will require more space.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Apache Spark Architecture Diagram<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The following diagram illustrates Spark architecture. Whenever an RDD is created in the Spark Context, it is then further distributed to the <em>Worker Nodes<\/em> for task execution alongside caching. The Worker Nodes, after task execution, send the results back to the Spark Context.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"596\" height=\"286\" class=\"wp-image-16217\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Spark-architecture.png\" alt=\"Apache Spark Architecture\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Spark-architecture.png 596w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Spark-architecture-300x144.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Spark-architecture-450x216.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Apache Spark architecture<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Hadoop MapReduce Architecture<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Hadoop comprises of two core components \u2013 HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator). As the name implies, HDFS manages big data storage across multiple nodes; while YARN manages processing tasks by resource allocation and job scheduling.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The HDFS architecture is based on two main nodes \u2013 a <em>NameNode<\/em>, and multiple <em>DataNodes<\/em>. These nodes exhibit a master\/slave architecture where a NameNode serves as the master managing storage and logging changes to the metadata of all files in a cluster. While the DataNodes are the slave nodes that perform NameNode\u2019s commands.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>YARN also comprises of two major components that manage the core functions of resource management and task scheduling. These are the <em>Resource Manager<\/em> and the <em>Node Managers<\/em>. Resource Manager is a cluster-level component (there can only be one per cluster), whereas Node Managers exist at the node level, making up several NodeManagers in a cluster.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Hadoop <\/strong><strong>MapReduce Diagram<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The following diagram shows the architecture of Hadoop HDFS. The NameNode saves the metadata of all stored files as well as logs any changes to the metadata. Whereas, the DataNodes store the actual data, attend read\/write requests and performs NameNode\u2019s instructions regarding creation, deletion, or replication of blocks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"874\" height=\"539\" class=\"wp-image-16218\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1.png\" alt=\"apache spark vs mapreduce\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1.png 874w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1-300x185.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1-768x474.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1-600x370.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1-450x278.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Hadoop HDFS architecture<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In YARN architecture, the Resource Manager allocates resources for running apps in a cluster via <em>Scheduler<\/em>.

However, developing the associated infrastructure may entail software development costs. From the viewpoint of Hadoop vs Apache Spark budget, Hadoop seems a cost-effective means for data analytics. It requires less RAM and can even work on commodity hardware.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Spark, on the other hand, requires more RAM since it works faster and does not consume disk I\/O. So, it may require pricey systems. However, as it boasts advanced technology, it requires less computation units, and this may lower the costs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Spark vs MapReduce<\/strong><strong> Compatibility<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Spark and Hadoop MapReduce are identical in terms of compatibility. While both can work as stand-alone applications, one can also run Spark on top of Hadoop YARN. Spark also supports Hadoop InputFormat data sources, thus showing compatibility with almost all Hadoop-supported file formats.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, Hadoop can also be integrated with various tools like Sqoop and Flume.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Apache Spark<\/strong><strong> And Hadoop Security <\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Spark supports authentication via shared secret. Its security features also include event logging, and it uses <em>javax servlet<\/em> filters for securing web user interface. Nevertheless, if it runs on YARN and integrates with HDFS, it may also leverage the potential of HDFS file permissions, Kerberos, and inter-node encryption.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"576\" class=\"wp-image-16220\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop.jpg 960w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop-600x360.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop-450x270.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, Hadoop surpasses Apache Spark in terms of security, as it supports Kerberos authentication. While Kerberos may be difficult to handle, Hadoop also supports third-party authentication, such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It also offers conventional file permissions, encryption, and access control lists (ACLs). Besides, it ensures providing appropriate user permissions for a job with Service Level Authorization (SLA). Here, Hadoop surpasses Spark in terms of security features.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>MapReduce Vs Spark<\/strong><strong> Use Cases<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While Apache Spark and Hadoop process big data in different ways, both the frameworks provide different benefits, and thus, have different use cases.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Apache Spark Use Cases<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Spark, being the faster, is suitable for processes where quick results are needed.
