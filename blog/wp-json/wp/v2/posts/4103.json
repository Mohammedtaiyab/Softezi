In 2016 alone, Swrve expanded its customer base by 44%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dean has held executive leadership roles in the mobile, SaaS, and IP industries for over 20 years, and specializes in growing disruptive startups. Before joining Swrve, Dean was Chief Revenue Officer of Urban Airship, where he managed the sales and business development to maximize revenue. He was also the Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Business Development Globally for Skype from 2008 to 2011, which was sold to Microsoft for $8.5B and is considered a leader of innovation in the Silicon Valley.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Q<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If it\u2019s not a secret, can you describe a couple of projects Swrve is currently working on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>A: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any development effort\u2014be it product or marketing, it\u2019s always important to keep the customer at the center for any initiative\u2014this applies to Swrve as well as for Swrve\u2019s customers. One of the key challenges that our customers have is how they can build customer lifetime value through their mobile strategy, specifically around loyalty and revenue. Here are two projects that are currently underway that we are working on to address this challenge: 1) A continuation of building out our mobile app analytics; and 2) seamless integration with a customer\u2019s existing and future stack. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to building customer lifetime value, there\u2019s no better approach than to understand your customer\u2019s experience and their journey in real time. \u00a0We are continually optimizing our real-time <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/mobile-development\">mobile app<\/a> analytics which enables marketers to optimize their customer\u2019s user experience through Swrve\u2019s A\/B testing platform for experimentation and testing\u2014whether it\u2019s a campaign or a native app experience. Our behavioral data analysis enables businesses to better understand what\u2019s working or not working for their customers and take action to address the issues or build predictive models for further optimization.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The real-time behavioral data is extremely useful not only in the mobile channel but it is also a very powerful component for other marketing channels \u2014 and vice versa.<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Along the same line, the real-time behavioral data is extremely useful not only in the mobile channel but it is also a very powerful component for other marketing channels \u2014 and vice versa. Our integration with Salesforce Marketing Cloud is another project that we continue to work on, in particular with their Journey Builder product. \u00a0We\u2019ve recently enhanced our integration where we can deliver multichannel customer journeys where the Swrve platform is focused on the mobile-first app experience and Salesforce is focused on the e-mail, web, SMS, social, and CRM. \u00a0Today, our integration enables Journey Builder to trigger:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rich In-app Messages and Conversations<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Push Notifications delivered by Swrve&#8217;s Best in Class Push (Optimized Copy, Optimal Delivery Time, Personalization, Localization, Enterprise Scale)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A New Customer Journey in Journey Build from any generic in-app mobile action<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An e-mail from a generic in-app mobile action.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An SMS from a generic in-app mobile action.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Audience Manager or Contact Record Update<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Synchronization between systems<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Q: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swrve provides a mobile engagement platform that\u2019s simple in usage and rich on features at the same time. Basically, it\u2019s the easiest way for a business to engage with its customers via mobile \u2014 out of the box. Drag-and-drop interface, A\/B testing, everything for the complete control over campaigns, and more. What inspired you to create it and what inspired you in the development process?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>A: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the core of Swrve\u2019s focus is what we call \u201cmobile moments.\u201d Delivering the best user experience at the right time can be challenging when your customers are everywhere and on different devices. We found that with the technology available today, like automation and machine learning, there are ways to stabilize and empower that engagement. We were inspired to create a mobile-first platform to unify mobile marketing efforts and unlock a dynamic user experience at scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>We found that with the technology available today, like automation and machine learning, there are ways to stabilize and empower mobile engagement. Mobile experiences must be hyper-aware of user concerns, or the users will drop.<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<p>We also saw a lot of unnecessary data silos in both legacy and emerging channels (mobile, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/social-networking\">social networks<\/a>, and messaging networks). In marketing, transparency is everything, so we were eager to establish new clarity. On mobile in particular, audiences are difficult to maintain. Attention spans are low, people have a sense of privacy and personal space and many are reticent to commit to downloading an app. Mobile experiences must be hyper-aware of user concerns, or the users will drop.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swrve\u2019s inception was actually driven by gaming apps. Upon discovering that 66 percent of mobile game players quit within the first 24 hours, Swrve\u2019s founders realized that there was a massive lack of clarity and engagement on mobile, and soon after, the company was born.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Q<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Your mobile engagement platform employs machine learning &amp; predictive models technology. Is there any other cutting-edge tech you plan to implement into your platform in the future?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>A<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine learning has always been at the core of what Swrve has delivered for its entire history. Our experience A\/B testing functionality uses a Bayesian engine to drive our User Experience optimization functionality. \u00a0As Swrve looks to our roadmap we will continue to invest into optimization and expand it beyond UX into optimal channels, timing, message content and other areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swrve also uses predictive models to deliver better results for our customers. \u00a0For example, 70 percent of our customer base use our \u201coptimal timing\u201d delivery feature that predicts at what time to deliver the message so the end user is most likely to open it. \u00a0We can also predict in certain use cases and vertical markets when a user will likely churn, convert or what their spend level will be.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>70% of our customer base use our \u201coptimal timing\u201d delivery feature that predicts at what time to deliver the message so the end user is most likely to open it.<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<p>We also offer an additional layer of analytics for a customer that has a data science team. The premium analytics offering allows any data science team to dive deeper into KPI\u2019s, and it can then sync with other data visualization tools like Tableau.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, we are working to expose an API to allow third-party AI &amp; predictive systems to send Swrve a trigger or event in real-time so that we can deliver a message or take an action in the mobile application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Q<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Mobile takes over one industry after another, but it didn\u2019t impact all of them yet. What industries are the next in line to embrace mobile when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/simple-guide-launch-mobile-app-marketing-campaign\">mobile marketing<\/a> and customer engagement? Which of them are the most challenging for your platform?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>A<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The proliferation of AI technology proposes a shift for all industries that implement digital technology. When companies undergo digital transformation, they\u2019re typically focused on automating and optimizing as much of their organization as possible\u2014including mobile. This process is more seamless for some industries than others. The industries that move the slowest are typically the ones with less consumer interaction or less existing software powering their business. Our belief is that the movement to mobile will eventually be universal\u2014especially for messaging purposes.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>We have one customer in the banking industry that told us that they have more customers in their mobile app in one minute than they in all their branches combined in a week.<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<p>It can sometimes feel that everybody is\u2014or wants to be\u2014\u201cmobile first.\u201d At least that was the feedback at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year. Enterprises in verticals like banking, telco, travel, and media, as well as commerce, are where we see consumers adopting app-based mobile first experiences to the greatest extent. \u00a0For example, we have one customer in the banking industry that told us that they have more customers in their mobile app in one minute than they in all their branches combined in a week. The reality is that consumers live on mobile, so brands needs to get there too. Organizations need to span across channels to truly reach their audiences at their convenience. Those that don\u2019t aggressively adopt new mobile-based interaction models\u2014particularly in the verticals and use cases that consumers have proven are best suited for mobile\u2014will be eclipsed by competitors that do.<\/p>\n<p><b>Q<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: What industries are the most challenging for your platform in general?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>A<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: On a high level, those that require building robust predictive models.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the use cases that combine our real-time segmentation and messaging capabilities, integrations with third-party systems (marketing clouds &amp; transactions systems) and our geofencing systems are the industries and use case that exercise our systems the most. \u00a0But our service was architected to handle these real-time interactions. Today we process 130,000 events per second in real-time, 12 billion a day, 360 billion a month, for 250 million monthly active users.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Mobile isn\u2019t \u2018on the rise\u2019 or \u2018enjoying explosive growth\u2019 anymore; it\u2019s the new paradigm.<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<p>In order to drive the best results, marketers need optimized models to predict when and how to engage with users. Mobile isn\u2019t \u2018on the rise\u2019 or \u2018enjoying explosive growth\u2019 anymore; it\u2019s the new paradigm. When users get stuck on a certain level of a mobile game, for example, we learned that they quit. In order to address this issue, we created a trigger that sends an in-app message to push the player to the next level, empowering the player to continue engaging with the platform.<\/p>\n<p><b>Q<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Are there any updates coming to your platform? How do they reflect your future development strategy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>A<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Our product vision goes a little like this: we enable you to know every customer, anticipate their needs and interact personally at the perfect moment.
