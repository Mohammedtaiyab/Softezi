The one which won&#8217;t slow you and your company down. You always can rebrand! This is the main takeaway from the latest <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Entrepreneurs-Founders-Showcase\/events\/115908762\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">meetup organised by Wix<\/a>.

For each group you need to understand who is your customers and where they are. Later this will help to use right PR and marketing tools to reach your clients.<\/p>\n<p>Jenny Hansen, founder at Small Business Big Plan reviewed branding from two perspectives &#8211; conventional and personal. I would like to deep into details of her presentation a bit more as I believe it would help you to avoid some common mistakes at the start.<\/p>\n<h3>Conventional branding:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>takes its cues from the established companies already operating in its marketplace<\/li>\n<li>hews closely to the status quo<\/li>\n<li>seeks to minimize risk<\/li>\n<li>strives for an instant read<\/li>\n<li>asks for little or no interaction from consumer<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Advantages:<\/h4>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>clarity of messages<\/li>\n<li>leverages the work already done by established business<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Disadvantages:<\/h4>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>can be too slick for a new company needed to make an impression<\/li>\n<li>in a new market category, convention only represents the current design trends<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Personal branding:<\/h3>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>stems from the vision of the founders<\/li>\n<li>seeks to position itself outside the status quo in its marketplace<\/li>\n<li>assumes the intelligence of its customers<\/li>\n<li>is willing to take the first risk in the interaction<\/li>\n<li>encourages engagement in return<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Advantages:<\/h4>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>the founders naturally and believable embody the brand<\/li>\n<li>has build-in latitude for adaptation and growth<\/li>\n<li>unlikely to become dated<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Disadvantages:<\/h4>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>brand guidelines must be well-defined it you have other contributors<\/li>\n<li>care must be taken that the overall message of legitimacy is never obscured<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2764\" title=\"wholefoods-traderjoe\" src=\"https:\/\/stanfy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/wholefoods-traderjoe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/wholefoods-traderjoe.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/wholefoods-traderjoe-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/wholefoods-traderjoe-450x225.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>Case Study: Whole Foods vs Trader Joe&#8217;s<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<h4>Whole Foods plays it safe:<\/h4>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>their site features contemporary but very template-looking design<\/li>\n<li>their copy is just this side of marketing speak<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Trader Joe&#8217;s takes risks:<\/h4>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>their graphics are a hodge-podge of clip-art-it makes designers cringe!<\/li>\n<li>they play with the company name<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>They set your expectations in multiple ways and consistent over the long-term, they aren&#8217;t trying to be clever &#8211; they actually are clever. They recognize that it&#8217;s not as risky as it seems and they back all the silliness up with the excellent products and loyal employees.<\/p>\n<h3>How to understand what approach is right for you?<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s no one right way to do it, so don&#8217;t stress over that. Work in your comfort zone. Don&#8217;t delay doing business trying to get your branding perfect the first time.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that the big brands are revamping their logos constantly. You will update yours eventually. You can always rebrand it you get a better idea later.
