Never mind that there are already a\u00a0thousand variations of\u00a0exactly what you want to\u00a0do\u2014your idea is\u00a0slightly different! It\u2019s sure to\u00a0catch on\u00a0because fill in\u00a0the blank.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Well hold your horses, cowboy! Before you go\u00a0running off to\u00a0your nearest Eastern European outsourcing company, there are a\u00a0few things you need to\u00a0do.<\/p>\n<h2>Let\u2019s take a\u00a0walk together:<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/market-product-research\">Market Research<\/a>: What\u2019s that you say? You\u2019ve got no\u00a0marketing experience? Oh\u2026you\u2019re just the guy with the idea? This is\u00a0wake up\u00a0No. 1: You need to\u00a0find your competitors and substitutes, analyze them, and consider the viability of\u00a0your product idea, or\u00a0figure out a\u00a0way to\u00a0make your idea, if\u00a0not better, at\u00a0least more popular than the other guy\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s OK\u00a0to\u00a0not be\u00a0unique, in\u00a0fact it\u2019s very difficult to\u00a0be\u00a0original in\u00a0the world of\u00a0decentralized development, but how will you make people switch to\u00a0your product from what they\u2019re already using? How will you steer them from your competitors and draw them into your app?<\/p>\n<p>Do\u00a0you even know what you want? What problem is\u00a0your app solving? How do\u00a0you plan to \u201chack\u201d it? Having an\u00a0app \u201cjust like Facebook,\u201d unfortunately is\u00a0not solving a\u00a0problem, because Facebook already exists. Granted, if\u00a0you\u2019ve got the money and you\u2019re willing to\u00a0spend it\u2014any company will make a \u201cHeadbook\u201d for you\u2026 or a \u201cLegbook\u2026\u201d pretty much any kind of\u00a0book. But you may end up\u00a0hitching your wagon to\u00a0a\u00a0horse with no\u00a0legs.<\/p>\n<p>If\u00a0you don\u2019t know what you want, how can the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\">app\u00a0development company<\/a> know? Having drawn upon market research of\u00a0your competitors, and having answered the question about the problem you want your app to\u00a0solve, you should get a\u00a0pretty good feel for what your end-goal\u00a0is. You can start to\u00a0feel out the road that you\u2019ll be\u00a0taking to\u00a0the finished product.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do\u00a0you have a\u00a0budget?<\/strong> It\u00a0may not be\u00a0every day, but it\u00a0happens often enough that it\u2019s become a\u00a0bit of\u00a0a\u00a0running joke: A\u00a0potential client phones us\u00a0up\u00a0and says: \u201cI want to\u00a0build an\u00a0app exactly like Twitter, but I\u2019ve only got about $1,000 dollars.\u201d Can you hear the crickets? It\u2019s kind of\u00a0an\u00a0awkward conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Do\u00a0you know how much you\u2019ll need? Do\u00a0you even know how software development businesses bill? Have you accounted for the price of\u00a0marketing and advertising? Unexpected delays in\u00a0development and the dreaded feature creep?<\/p>\n<p>Of\u00a0course you haven\u2019t, you Hun! Think about this: you\u2019re paying a\u00a0company ~$50.00\/hour to\u00a0build your app. Three guys have a\u00a0meeting for one hour to\u00a0discuss your app. That meeting cost you $150.00. That\u2019s the way it\u00a0works: you\u2019re paying for man-hours and you\u2019re renting a\u00a0team. But here\u2019s the good news: you can trim a\u00a0lot of\u00a0those extra hours if\u00a0you already have the first two points figured out! Just be\u00a0prepared: estimates are rarely realized on\u00a0the low-end, bugs happen in\u00a0every software, and delays pop-up like sales at\u00a0Walmart.<\/p>\n<p>When allotting your budget, understand that the amount you\u2019re willing and able to\u00a0spend is\u00a0directly proportional to\u00a0the speed required to\u00a0finish the project and the quality of\u00a0the final product.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do\u00a0you have a\u00a0strategy?<\/strong> Have you ever played Fool\u2019s Mate? It\u2019s like chess\u2014but it\u2019s when you get checkmated in\u00a0about three moves. It\u2019s because you didn\u2019t have a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/product-strategy\">strategy<\/a>; the other guy saw it\u00a0and pulled out one of\u00a0the oldest plays in\u00a0the book, set you up\u00a0and took you down before you even knew the game had started.<\/p>\n<p>When you want to\u00a0develop a\u00a0mobile application, you need to\u00a0know what you\u2019re going to\u00a0do\u00a0to get it\u00a0off the ground, and most importantly: what are you NOT going to\u00a0do?<\/p>\n<p><strong>How much magic is\u00a0involved?<\/strong> Flappy Bird took a\u00a0weekend to\u00a0build and has been earning its owner approximately $50k a\u00a0day. Angry Birds gained millions of\u00a0users almost overnight, and WhatsApp got bought for $19 Billion. Which one do\u00a0you plan to\u00a0be? Hopefully none of\u00a0them: for every story you hear similar to\u00a0these, there are about 5000 startups that crashed and burned. So\u00a0how do\u00a0you expect your idea to\u00a0catch on? What is\u00a0the size of\u00a0your market? Do\u00a0you understand what kind of\u00a0audience you\u2019re trying to\u00a0reach and more importantly, how to\u00a0reach them?<\/p>\n<p>If\u00a0you don\u2019t have answers to\u00a0these questions, (and worse: if\u00a0you haven\u2019t asked these questions at\u00a0all) then you may face far more than a\u00a0rude awakening. While 5-7 years ago you may have survived on\u00a0the App Store without a\u00a0strategy, those lucky days are over and you\u2019ll probably lose your investment. Back then the App Store was just finding its feet, now everyone is\u00a0in\u00a0the game and you need to\u00a0understand that your idea is\u00a0not unique\u2014so you need to\u00a0know precisely how you\u2019re going to\u00a0tackle and dominate your niche market. So\u00a0get crackin\u2019!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You had an idea: Good for you!
