Nobody knows how many of his arrows will reach their targets, but one will surely hit the heart of the retail industry. Carved on the wood of the arrow will be, curtly, \u201cm-commerce.\u201d The relationship between the two is promising \u2014 everybody loves mobile, especially the customers, who increasingly prefer shopping with their smartphones via <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/dawn-new-shopping-age\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">apps for retail<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to TPoll, the number of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/radiumone.com\/press-release\/must-love-valentines-day-customers-go-increasingly-mobile\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consumers in UK<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who said they will purchase a gift on Lover\u2019s Day with their smartphone was at 26% in 2015. In the following year, 48% of searches on this day on Bing were made via mobile devices. Valentine\u2019s Day becomes a mobile holiday, a trend that a lot of world-class brands started embracing a few years ago with their creative usage of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">m-commerce apps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including Walmart\u2019s spot-on messaging and Uber\u2019s flower delivery.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Best Valentine\u2019s Day technology for <\/b><b>retail apps<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to the retail industry\u2019s shift from e-commerce to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/two-m-commerce-technologies-set-change-industry-year\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">m-commerce technology<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the future is promisingly sunlit. The industry will have an opportunity to leverage and experiment with a lot of advancements to amaze the customers in new ways with their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retail apps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some of these technologies are big, complex, and brand new. Still, a simpler solution that is tried-and-true is often the most effective option. With retail apps it is push notifications, which can be paired with spot-on messaging and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/geolocation-navigation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beacons<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for maximum effect. Here, companies could follow the example of Walmart \u2014 they make the most of this <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">m-commerce technology<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and put their customers in the mood for the day while reaching out to them with the right offers. In 2017 and beyond, companies should consider leveraging the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/notification-service\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">notifications<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and adjacent tech more frequently. A lot of customers live on a busy schedule, and can be notified of buying presents at the right time and place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Apps for retail<\/b><b> with AR are here<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Pokemon Go was released it left people all over the world baffled: it was an experience both old and new, a rare kind of digital entertainment that demanded going out into the streets of your town and discovering it anew. Retailers were more practical and promptly started leveraging the sensational technology to their advantage, attracting customers to physical stores. Now, the\u00a0retail industry will be first to adopt AR on a large scale. We mentioned the mind-bending sales experience of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BMW<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that was announced in 2016, but Starbucks tried the technology in its <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retailer app<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as far back as 2012, albeit in a simpler way. \u00a0As for the future, GAP has already showed its deeply elaborate <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/video\/future-shopping-ar-apps-from-gap-amazon-and-more\/A997B23A-70E0-47AF-AB73-26561D3BF0CD.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR shopping experience<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which will leave naysayers as amazed as customers \u2014 some of them will save time, and some will no longer worry that an item order outside their country won\u2019t fit. AR is bound to become the most meaningful <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">m-commerce technology<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for retail.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Most inventive usage of <\/b><b>retail apps<\/b><b> on Valentine\u2019s Day<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the most romantic holiday of the year is about universal concepts of love and relationships, companies offer incredibly creative ways for the customers to surprise their loved ones. In 2013, Uber transformed its ride-hailing service to a flower-delivery service. Until the biggest social media become somewhat overused, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UwwCGyGsjcA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orange encouraged<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pairs to tweet their love stories in 2011, and in 2012 one beverage company used the paired power of Facebook\u2019s and its own <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">m-commerce app<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help shy users reach out to their love interest with a custom serenade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How Uber, Starbucks, and other companies breath new life in another holiday that goes mobile.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":63,"featured_media":3690,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2,13],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Best Valentine\u2019s Day technology for retail apps.
