<div class="faq__wrapper">
<div class="faq__item">
<h2 class="faq__title">Why you should consider investing in iOS app development services?</h2>
<p class="faq__text"><span class="faq__content">According to Statista, mobile apps will reach $188.9 billion in revenue by 2020, a twofold increase compared to 2016. As Apple devices are consistently popular with consumers, much of that revenue will come from those devices and the iOS platform. The bar for app quality has also risen over the years. Therefore, iOS app development that would ensure a continuously engaging product is a solid investment.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="faq__item">
<h2 class="faq__title">Why your product should rely on iOS app developers that continuously improve their skills?</h2>
<p class="faq__text"><span class="faq__content">With iOS 12, Apple has finally shown that it is willing to deliver their latest updates to as much devices as possible, including models that are more than two years old. This has led to 78 percent of Apple users installing iOS 12 only three months after release, according to Apple. Turning to iOS app developers who keep track of changes in the platform and always improve their skills guarantees your product will work consistently across every Apple device. Intellectsoft’s experts will also make sure your application leverages the benefits of the latest versions of iOS properly, including Augmented Reality and Machine Learning.</span></p>
